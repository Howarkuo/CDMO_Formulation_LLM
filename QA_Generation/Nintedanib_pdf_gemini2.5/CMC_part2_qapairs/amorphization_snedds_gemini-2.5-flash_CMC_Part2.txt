=== PHARMACEUTICAL CMC & SCALE-UP ANALYSIS (Part 2) ===

SUMMARY:
The study successfully developed a novel Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery System (SNEDDS) formulation for nintedanib (NTD), a poorly soluble drug, to enhance its oral absorption. Key findings include the effective co-amorphization of NTD with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), which significantly improved NTD's solubility by disrupting its high crystallinity. The optimized SNEDDS, comprising Capryol 90, Cremophor EL, Transcutol P (4:3:3 w/w/w) and 2% HPMCP-50, demonstrated superior dissolution in small intestinal luminal conditions compared to the marketed Ofev® and NTD-ESA. In vivo studies in rats confirmed that this 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS significantly enhanced NTD absorption and reduced inter-individual variability. While promising, the authors acknowledge a "large discrepancy" between in vitro and in vivo results, necessitating further investigation into the underlying reasons for improved drug formulation.

CRITICAL RISK FACTORS & SOLUTIONS (16-20)
============================================================

Risk/Question: 16. What is the risk associated with maintaining the amorphous state of the NTD-CSA complex during large-scale manufacturing and long-term storage?
Solution & Reasoning: The amorphous form of NTD-CSA, while enhancing solubility, is thermodynamically unstable and prone to recrystallization, especially under stress conditions (e.g., elevated temperature, humidity, mechanical stress during processing). For scale-up, maintaining the amorphous state consistently across large batches is challenging due to potential variations in drying kinetics (e.g., freeze-drying parameters like shelf temperature, vacuum pressure, and duration), milling intensity, and subsequent handling. Recrystallization would lead to reduced solubility and variable dissolution rates, directly impacting product efficacy and stability. A robust manufacturing process must define critical process parameters for freeze-drying and subsequent handling, coupled with in-process controls (e.g., XRPD, DSC) to ensure amorphous content. Furthermore, long-term stability studies under various ICH conditions are crucial to confirm the amorphous form's integrity over the product's shelf-life.
Source Paragraph: The solid states of NTD-CSA and NTD-ESA were examined by DSC (Fig. 3 (A)) and XRPD (Fig. 3 (B)). NTD-ESA provided a large endothermic peak around 300°C in DSC thermogram and many sharp diffraction peaks in XRPD pattern, which are very similar with those reported (Zhu et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022). In our previous study (Sumimoto et al., 2022), ESA formed the co-amorphous complex with mebendazole. However, NTD-ESA was confirmed to be crystalline with high melting point (Fig. 3). In contrast, both DSC and XRPD charts revealed a hallo pattern for NTD-CSA (Fig. 3 (A) and (B)), clearly indicating that NTD-CSA should be amorphous. The reason why only CSA has disrupted the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA would be as follows. Since the planarity and/or symmetry is considered to be an issue to be overcome to enhance the solubility of brick dust-like drugs (Ishikawa and Hashimoto, 2011), the steric structure of CSA as shown in Fig. 1 (D) would efficiently have disrupted the crystal packing of NTD-ESA and would have been stably co-amorphized with NTD.

Risk/Question: 17. What are the scale-up risks associated with the fixed excipient ratio (Capryol 90: Cremophor EL: Transcutol P = 4:3:3) and the inclusion of HPMCP-50 in the SNEDDS formulation?
Solution & Reasoning: The fixed excipient ratio, while effective at lab scale, may not be robust enough for large-scale production. Batch-to-batch variability in raw material properties (e.g., purity, viscosity) of Capryol 90, Cremophor EL, and Transcutol P could alter the self-emulsification efficiency and nanoemulsion characteristics. HPMCP-50, a polymer, can exhibit different hydration and swelling properties depending on mixing conditions (e.g., shear, temperature, order of addition) at scale, potentially affecting its ability to maintain supersaturation and prevent precipitation. The study notes that HPMCP-50 aggregated in some conditions, which is a significant concern for product consistency. Comprehensive Design of Experiments (DoE) studies are essential to map the design space for excipient ratios and HPMCP-50 concentration, identifying critical material attributes and process parameters that influence nanoemulsion formation, stability, and drug release, ensuring consistent performance upon scale-up.
Source Paragraph: The solubilities of NTD-ESA (Table 2) and NTD-CSA (Table 3) in each excipient indicated that Capryol 90 and Transcutol P should be selected as an oil component and a cosolvent of SNEDDS, respectively. Furthermore, since our previous results revealed that Capryol 90: Cremophor EL: Transcutol P = 4:3:3 (w/w/w) with or without HPMCP-50 provided a larger area of nanoemulsion formation in the psuedo-ternary phase diagrams and the good performance for brick dust-like drugs in in vitro and in vivo studies (Okawa et al., 2021; Sumimoto et al., 2022), the composition was chosen to prepare the SNEDDS vehicle. To estimate the improvement of solubility of NTD in SNEDDS by each NTD-counter ion complex, SNEDDS vehicle was prepared first and then, each complex was put into the SNEDDS vehicle and its solubility was examined.

Risk/Question: 18. What is the risk of inconsistent nanoemulsion droplet size and aggregation, particularly with HPMCP-50, during scale-up and in vivo performance?
Solution & Reasoning: The observation of "very large sizes and pdi values" and HPMCP-50 aggregation in certain aqueous vehicles (Table 4) is a critical concern for scale-up. Inconsistent particle size distribution and aggregation can lead to variable drug release, reduced absorption, and compromised bioavailability. At larger scales, mixing efficiency, shear forces, and temperature control during SNEDDS preparation and subsequent dilution in the gastrointestinal tract can significantly influence nanoemulsion formation and stability. The noted aggregation of HPMCP-50 suggests potential compatibility or solubility issues with other SNEDDS components or physiological fluids. Robust in-process controls for mixing and homogenization, along with advanced analytical techniques like dynamic light scattering (DLS) and microscopy, are essential to monitor droplet size and detect aggregation. Further formulation optimization regarding HPMCP-50 content and SNEDDS components is needed to ensure consistent and stable nanoemulsion performance across different physiological conditions.
Source Paragraph: Since we observed that pH3.9 buffer and pH6.5 FaSSIF became cloudy during the dissolution studies above, the particle sizes of nanoemulsion droplets diluted with distilled water, pH3.9 buffer, or pH6.5 FaSSIF were determined for NTD-CSA SNEDDS with or without 2% HPMCP-50 and compared with those for SNEDDS vehicle and 2% HPMCP-50 SNEDDS without NTD-CSA (Table 4). NTD-CSA increased the droplet sizes only in distilled water, but to a lesser extent. HPMCP-50 increased those in distilled water and pH3.9 acetate buffer, revealing that HPMCP-50 tended to increase droplet sizes more than NTD-CSA except in FaSSIF. Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of both NTD-CSA and 2% HPMCP-50 unexpectedly resulted in very large sizes and pdi values in all the aqueous vehicles (Table 4). However, Figs. 6 and 7 indicated that NTD-CSA was almost completely dissolved in the filtrate through 0.45 µm filter and the concentrations of NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase of buffers were very low (Fig. 8), indicating that almost all of NTD-CSA should be incorporated into the nanoemulsion droplets and/or micelles less than 450 nm in diameter. Then, we confirmed that nanoemulsion droplets in the supernatant obtained after centrifuging the samples prepared for determining the particle size were smaller than those before centrifugation, also less than 450 nm (Table 4). Furthermore, 106.3 ± 5.3% (n = 3), 95.8 ± 1.7% (n = 3), and 87.7 ± 4.1% (n = 3) of NTD were recovered in the obtained supernatant for distilled water, acetate buffer, and pH6.5 FaSSIF, respectively. Although the recovery in pH6.5 FaSSIF was lower than others, NTD would have been precipitated following its release from nanoemulsion droplets, which might have been induced due to the release of HPMCP-50, soluble in pH6.5 FaSSIF, during the centrifugation. Therefore, we think that larger particles detected would be aggregates formed by HPMCP-50 itself, which were also observed in our previous study (Sumimoto et al., 2022). The details remain to be clarified, but NTD-CSA might have decreased the solubility of HPMCP-50 in SNEDDS vehicle and HPMCP-50 pushed out from the nanoemulsion droplets would have aggregated. This possibility suggests that formulation improvement should be needed in terms of HPMCP-50 contents and the components of SNEDDS vehicle.

Risk/Question: 19. What is the risk associated with the lack of comprehensive long-term stability data and potential chemical degradation of the API and excipients in the proposed SNEDDS formulation?
Solution & Reasoning: The explicit statement that "further detailed stability analysis for every ingredient used and possible chemical degradation of APIs will be required" indicates a significant gap in the current understanding of the formulation's long-term stability. SNEDDS formulations, being complex mixtures of oils, surfactants, and co-solvents, are susceptible to various degradation pathways, including hydrolysis, oxidation, and transesterification, which can affect both the API (NTD-CSA) and the excipients. The amorphous nature of NTD-CSA also increases its susceptibility to chemical degradation. Without comprehensive stability studies under various ICH conditions (e.g., accelerated, long-term, stress testing), the shelf-life, storage conditions, and potential formation of impurities cannot be reliably established. This poses a substantial risk to product quality, safety, and regulatory approval, as degradation products could be toxic or lead to reduced efficacy.
Source Paragraph: Of course, further detailed stability analysis for every ingredient used and possible chemical degradation of APIs will be required to bring this formulation to market.

Risk/Question: 20. What is the risk associated with the "large discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo performances" and the lack of clarity regarding its underlying reasons for the NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulation?
Solution & Reasoning: The acknowledged "large discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo performances" is a critical risk for tech-transfer and regulatory approval. A poor in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) means that in vitro dissolution tests, which are crucial for quality control, batch release, and assessing post-approval changes, may not accurately predict the drug's performance in patients. The authors themselves list several potential reasons for this discrepancy, including in vivo precipitation, changes in nanoemulsion properties, and gastrointestinal nucleation, indicating a complex interplay of factors not fully captured by current in vitro models. To mitigate this, extensive mechanistic studies are needed to understand the in vivo fate of the SNEDDS, including biorelevant dissolution testing under dynamic conditions that mimic gastrointestinal physiology (e.g., fed/fasted states, enzymatic digestion). Establishing a robust IVIVC is paramount to ensure that the in vitro methods are truly predictive of clinical outcomes and to support future formulation changes or manufacturing site transfers.
Source Paragraph: The differences that the in vivo study provided would likely come to be more moderate, compared with the differences observed in the in vitro studies (McEvoy et al., 2014), but the reasons for such a large discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo remain to be clarified. Then, we have attempted to discuss the issue as follows: (i) Reasons for oral absorption higher than expected for NTD-CSA, NTD-NSA powders; Very good dissolution of NTD in pH3.9 acetate buffer (Fig. 6 (A)) suggests that the "spontaneous supersaturation" (Brouwers et al., 2009) would have been formed after transferred to the small intestine, which would largely contribute to the absorption from the proximal regions of small intestine. In fact, it was reported that the oral absorption of atazanavir (Tomilo et al., 2006) or itraconazole (Lim et al., 1993; Willems et al., 2001) was dependent on the degree of spontaneous supersaturation. (ii) Reasons for oral absorption lower than expected for SNEDDS formulations; a) In contrast, the higher degree of supersaturation may lead to the lower BA as in the case of solid dispersion preparations of itraconazole (Six et al., 2005). In such a case, since the nucleation rate is highly dependent on the degree of supersaturation (Brouwers et al., 2009), the nucleation rates increased dependent on the extent of supersaturation might have been superior to the absorption rates of dissolved itraconazole emptied from the stomach. For the absorption rate to exceed the precipitation rate, therefore, it should still be important to maintain the supersaturation after transferred to the small intestine. b) Taking into account of considerations above, the maintenance of supersaturation as observed in the in vitro dissolution study (Fig. 7 (A)) might not have occurred in vivo after oral dosing. In the current study, we performed the in vitro dissolution studies at constant acidic (pH3.9) or neutral condition (pH6.5), but some phenomena might have occurred only through a sequential exposure from the gastric to the small intestinal environments in vivo, i.e., i) possible changes in physicochemical properties of nanoemulsion droplets and/or lipoidal component forming nanoemulsion droplets, ii) subsequent changes in release properties of drugs from nanoemulsion droplets. iii) NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase at higher concentrations under acidic condition than those under neutral condition (Fig. 8) might have precipitated instead of being absorbed after transferred to the small intestine. iv) This precipitation might have also facilitated the nucleation of NTD newly released from nanoemulsion droplets and/or micelles. c) "Nucleation in the gastrointestinal lumen will be facilitated by various surfaces and interfaces, only existing in vivo, that may act a catalyst for nucleation" (Brouwers et al., 2009). Some lipoidal components forming nanoemulsion droplets would be subjected to digestion and/or absorption (Mu et al., 2013), which would facilitate the release of drugs from nanoemulsion droplets.
