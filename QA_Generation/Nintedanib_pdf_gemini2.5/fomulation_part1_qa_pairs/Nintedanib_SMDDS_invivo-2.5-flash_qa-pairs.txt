=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS ===

SUMMARY:
This study successfully developed a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for nintedanib, a triple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with poor solubility and low bioavailability. The optimized formulation, comprising MCT as the oil phase, Cremophor RH 40 as the surfactant, and ethylene glycol as the co-surfactant, resulted in a stable microemulsion with an average droplet size of approximately 23 nm. Key findings include a significant 2.8-fold enhancement in nintedanib permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers and a 3.0-fold increase in intestinal permeability in vivo. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) for NDNB-SMEDDS compared to the soft capsule, confirming improved oral absorption and bioavailability. The formulation exhibited low cytotoxicity, making it a promising strategy for enhancing oral drug delivery.

The physicochemical properties of NDNB-SMEDDS, viz., morphological observation, droplet size, stability, compatibility and in vitro release were investigated. The permeability of NDNB-SMEDDS was detected using both a Caco-2 cell monolayer in vitro and an intestinal perfusion study in vivo. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic character- istics of NDNB-SMEDDS were evaluated.

Q: 6. How much was the permeability of nintedanib enhanced in a Caco-2 cell monolayer when incorporated into SMEDDS?
A & Reasoning: The permeability of nintedanib in a Caco-2 cell monolayer was enhanced by 2.8-fold upon incorporation in SMEDDS compared with the drug solution. Reasoning: This indicates that the SMEDDS formulation effectively improves the transcellular or paracellular transport of nintedanib across the intestinal epithelial barrier, a key factor for oral absorption.

Q: 7. What was the observed increase in apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) for NDNB-SMEDDS in the in vivo intestinal perfusion study?
A & Reasoning: The Papp of NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 3.0-fold in the entire intestine and 3.2-fold in the colon in comparison with the drug solution. Reasoning: This in vivo data corroborates the in vitro findings, demonstrating that SMEDDS significantly enhances nintedanib's permeability across different segments of the rat intestine, including the colon.
Source Paragraph: The intestinal perfusion study demonstrated that the Papp of NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 3.0-fold in the entire intestine and 3.2-fold in the colon in comparison with the drug solution. The pharmacokinetics study showed that the AUC of the NDNB-SMEDDS increased significantly.

Q: 8. What was the key pharmacokinetic parameter improvement observed for NDNB-SMEDDS?
A & Reasoning: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the NDNB-SMEDDS increased significantly. Reasoning: An increased AUC indicates a higher systemic exposure to the drug, directly correlating with improved oral bioavailability and overall drug absorption.

Q: 9. What was the solubility of nintedanib in pH 7.4 PBS without Tween 80, and how did it change with Tween 80?
A & Reasoning: The solubility of nintedanib in pH 7.4 PBS without Tween 80 was 5.13 µg·mL⁻¹. With the addition of 0.5% Tween 80, the solubility increased to 132.42 µg·mL⁻¹. Reasoning: This demonstrates that nintedanib has very low solubility under neutral physiological conditions, and the addition of a surfactant like Tween 80 significantly enhances its solubility, which is crucial for improving dissolution and absorption.
Source Paragraph: The solubility of nintedanib in different pH conditions, viz., pH6.8 PBS (with, or without 0.5% Tween 80) and pH7.4 PBS (with or without 0.5% Tween 80) was detected to predict its solubility under physiological conditions and a sink condition for the in vitro release study. As shown in Table 2, the solubility of nintedanib in the pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 condition was very low, which lead to its poor absorption in the intestine. In order to increase the solubility at physiological pH, 0.5% Tween 80 was added to pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 PBS, and the solubility of ninte- danib enhanced from 11.98 to 441.67 and 5.13 to 132.42 μg. mL¯¹ respectively, which could satisfy the sink condition.

Q: 10. What does the LogP value of nintedanib indicate about its lipophilicity?
A & Reasoning: The LogP of nintedanib in both pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 water phases was more than 2, indicating that nintedanib was more lipophilic than being hydrophilic. Reasoning: A LogP value greater than 2 suggests that nintedanib has a higher affinity for the oil phase than the water phase, classifying it as a lipophilic drug. This property is relevant for SMEDDS formulation, as such drugs can be effectively solubilized in the oil phase.
Source Paragraph: As displayed in Table 3, the oil/water partition coeffi- cient (LogP) of nintedanib varied with water phase. The LogP of nintedanib in both pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 water phases were more than 2, indicating that nintedanib was more lipophilic than being hydrophilic. Even when the solubilizer Tween 80 was used in the water phase, the solubility of nintedanib in the oil phase was still higher than that in the water phase. As reported in the literature, SMEDDS approaches are potentially useful for drugs with poor water-solubility and intermediate partition coefficients (2<LogP<4).29 Properly designed SMEDDS formulations may provide an opportunity to improve the intestinal absorption of nintedanib which has poor solubility in phy- siological conditions.

Q: 11. What are the three essential components of a SMEDDS formulation?
A & Reasoning: SMEDDS are comprised of an oil phase, emulsifier, and co-emulsifier. Reasoning: These three components work synergistically to form a stable microemulsion upon dilution with aqueous media, facilitating the solubilization and absorption of poorly soluble drugs.
Source Paragraph: Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) which have high solubilization potential and thermodynamic stability are considered ideal alternative oral drug delivery carriers for drugs with poor solubility in water. Notably, SMEDDS are comprised of an oil phase, emulsifier and co-emulsifier. In terms of the main feature, SMEDDS can automatically form a water-containing (O/W) type of micro- emulsion under physiological conditions, such as body tem- perature and gastrointestinal peristalsis.12 Functionally, SMEDDS can improve the solubility and permeability of drugs, as well as increase the absorption rate of drugs to increase bioavailability and drug stability.13–15 Consequently, SMEDDS technology has been applied to a series of drugs, such as dipyridamole, 16 nifedipine,17 ibuprofen, 18 loratadine19 and docetaxel20 with enhanced absorption being demonstrated.

Q: 12. What is an important criterion for selecting surfactants in SMEDDS formulations?
A & Reasoning: The hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) value is an important criterion for the selection of surfactants, with the value usually above 10. Reasoning: Surfactants with HLB values above 10 are typically hydrophilic and effective in forming oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, which are characteristic of SMEDDS.
Source Paragraph: Based on the preliminary solubility and compatibility experiments, MCT was finally selected as an oil phase. The hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) value is an important criterion for the selection of surfactants with the value usually above 10. Cremophor EL35 (HLB 13.5) and Cremophor RH 40 (HLB 14–16) are non-ionic, biocompa- tible surfactants approved for oral administration. In pre- liminary studies, Cremophor EL35 (HLB 13.5) and Cremophor RH 40 along with three co-surfactants were examined. Cremophor RH 40 exhibited a better emulsifying effect and was selected as the surfactant. Co-surfactants can enhance drug solubility within the formulation, and more importantly, could reduce the interfacial tension and increase the stability of the emulsion, which are most crucial for the emulsion system.

Q: 13. Which co-surfactant was selected as optimal for the NDNB-SMEDDS formulation and why?
A & Reasoning: Ethylene glycol was selected as the optimal co-surfactant because the microemulsion area in the pseudo-ternary phase diagram (diagram B) with ethylene glycol was larger compared to PEG400 (diagram A) and glycerol (diagram C). Reasoning: A larger microemulsion region indicates a wider range of component ratios that can form stable microemulsions, signifying better formulation robustness and emulsifying efficiency.
Source Paragraph: In this study, ethylene glycol, PEG400 and glycerol were assessed as the co-sur- factants. The pseudo-ternary phase diagram is well docu- mented in the literature and has extensively been reported for the selection of the components of the microemulsions. The black areas of phase diagrams indicate the ME regions, whereas the white area represents the turbid region. As shown in Figure 1, the microemulsion area of diagram B with ethylene glycol as a co-surfactant was larger than diagram A (PEG400) and diagram C (glycerol). Based on this finding, ethylene glycol was selected as a co-surfactant.

Q: 14. What was the optimal surfactant to co-surfactant (Km) ratio determined for the NDNB-SMEDDS formulation?
A & Reasoning: The optimal surfactant to co-surfactant (Km) ratio was confirmed as 2:1. Reasoning: This ratio yielded the widest microemulsion area in the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams, indicating the most stable and efficient emulsification for the chosen components.
Source Paragraph: The Km was confirmed by comparing the microemul- sion area of ternary phase diagrams constructed with dif- ferent ratios of surfactants to co-surfactants. As shown in Figure 1A–E, comparing with diagram d and e, the area of diagram b was wider, so Km was confirmed as 2:1.

Pair #15
Q: 15. What was the polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the NDNB-SMEDDS, and what do these values indicate?
A & Reasoning: The polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.201, indicating uniformity of droplet size, and the zeta potential was about -19.5±2.3 mV. Reasoning: A low PDI (typically < 0.3) signifies a narrow and homogeneous size distribution of droplets, which is desirable for stability and consistent drug release. A zeta potential of -19.5±2.3 mV, while not extremely high, contributes to the stability of the microemulsion by providing electrostatic repulsion between droplets, preventing aggregation.
Source Paragraph: It was observed that NDNB-SMEDDS dispersed in water rapidly with the micro-emulsion being clear and slightly bluish in appearance at a recorded emulsifying time of about 47.2±0.6 s. As shown in Figure 2, the appearance of NDNB-SMEDDS was a clear yellow transparent liquid (Figure 2A). The average droplet size was about 23 nm (Figure 2B), which was consistent with that of the mor- phological characterization (Figure 2C). The index of polydispersity (PDI) was 0.201, which indicated the uni- formity of the droplet size within the formulation. The zeta potential was about -19.5±2.3_mV. A_previous report indicated that the smaller size of the microemulsion dro- plet was beneficial for increasing the in vivo absorption of the drug, while a lower zeta potential value could increase the stability of the self-microemulsion.30

Q: 16. What were the stability findings for NDNB-SMEDDS over 30 days?
A & Reasoning: After 30 days stored at 4°C and 30°C, NDNB-SMEDDS showed no significant change in appearance or particle size, remaining a pale yellow transparent liquid without turbidity and delamination. Reasoning: This indicates good physical stability of the formulation under different storage conditions, which is essential for product shelf-life and consistent performance.
Source Paragraph: As shown in Table 4, after 30 days stored at 4°C and 30°C, NDNB-SMEDDS showed no significant change in appear- ance and particle size. It was still a pale yellow transparent liquid without turbidity and delamination. The results inferred that the prepared NDNB-SMEDDS had a good stability within 30 days.

Q: 17. What were the cytotoxicity results of NDNB-SMEDDS on Caco-2 cells?
A & Reasoning: The NDNB-SMEDDS showed low toxicity, with cell viability remaining over 90% in the dosage range of 1–40 µg·mL⁻¹. Reasoning: This indicates that the formulation is relatively safe for intestinal cells at relevant concentrations, which is a critical factor for oral drug delivery systems.
Source Paragraph: An MTT assay was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of NDNB-SMEDDS and the blank carrier. As shown in Figure 4, the blank SMEDDS did not show significant cyto- toxicity in the dosage range of 1 to 40 µg·mL¯¹, while a slight inhibition effect on cell proliferation was observed at the concentration of the blank carrier higher than 80 µg·mL¯¹. This result is in good agreement with other published results.31 Because of the high concentration of surfactants used in SMEDDS, in vitro cell toxicity has been reported in many published studies. However, there are some differences between in vitro cell studies and in vivo conditions. For instance, the physiological sink conditions could dilute the dosage concentration, while the intestinal epithelium might be protected by the mucus layers.32 Besides, the incubation time in the present study was long (24 hrs), which was much longer than the potential residence time of the drug in the intestinal tract. It could be speculated that the carriers may have very little influence on the gastrointestinal membrane. Indeed, SMEDDS loaded with nintedanib showed a little higher cytotoxicity than the blank SMEDDS. However, the cell viability was over 90% in the range of 1–40 µg·mL¯¹, which suggested a low toxicity of the formulation and the potential to be used in the clinical setting.

Q: 18. Based on Caco-2 cell permeability, how is nintedanib classified, and how does SMEDDS affect this classification?
A & Reasoning: According to the Caco-2 cell permeability classification, nintedanib (solution) belongs to low permeability substances (Papp < 1×10⁻⁶ cm·s⁻¹). However, when incorporated into SMEDDS, its Papp (A to B) increased by 2.8-fold, classifying it as a medium permeability substance. Reasoning: This shift from low to medium permeability demonstrates the significant improvement in nintedanib's ability to cross the intestinal barrier when formulated as SMEDDS, directly addressing its poor absorption issue.
Source Paragraph: The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp A to B) of NDNB-SMEDDS were 0.927×10¯º and 2.563×10¯º cm·s¯¹, respectively. Generally, substances with Papp >1×10¯5 cm·s¯¹ are classified as having high permeability. Medium permeability substances possess Papp values between 1×10¯5 and 1×10¯6 cm·s¯¹, while sub- stances with Papp < 1×10-6 cm·s¯¹ belong to low permeabil- ity substances.34 The calculated Papp (A to B) of the solution was between 1×10~5 and 1×10¯6 cm·s¯¹, which belongs to the medium permeability substance category. According to the classification, nintedanib belongs to low permeability substances, while the Papp (A to B) of NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 2.8-fold compared with that of the solution, which could be classified as medium permeability. It was indicated that SMEDDS could significantly increase the per- meability efficiency of nintedanib. Additionally, the perme- ated amounts of nintedanib across the cell monolayers from basolateral to apical directions (B to A) were lower than that from apical to basolateral directions (A to B), while the efflux ratio was less than 1 for both drug solution and SMEDDS.

Q: 19. What are the key differences between the single pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) and closed-loop Doluisio methods for in vivo drug permeability evaluation?
A & Reasoning: In the SPIP method, each drug molecule has only one chance to pass through the intestine, while in the closed-loop Doluisio method, the drug solution remains within the investigated intestinal segment during the entire experiment. The Doluisio method also requires only a small volume of drug solution and can reflect the initial non-equilibrium phase of drug transport. Reasoning: These methodological differences impact how drug exposure and absorption kinetics are measured, with the Doluisio method providing insights into prolonged exposure within a specific intestinal segment.
Source Paragraph: There are two commonly used perfusion methods to evaluate the drug permeability in vivo, namely the single pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) model and the closed- loop Doluisio method. In the SPIP approach, each drug molecule only has one chance to pass through the intes- tine, whereas in the Doluisio method the drug solution remains within the investigated intestinal segment during the entire experiment,27 indicating that only a small volume of drug solution is required. Moreover, the initial non-equilibrium phase of the drug transport could reflect in the Doluisio method. In this study, the Doluisio method was chosen to evaluate the permeability of the nintedanib solution and NDNB-SMEDDS in the small intestine and colon.

Q: 20. How did NDNB-SMEDDS affect the Cmax and Tmax compared to the nintedanib soft capsule?
A & Reasoning: The Cmax of NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 2.3-fold (6.084±0.591 µg·mL⁻¹) compared to the nintedanib soft capsule (2.651±0.290 µg·mL⁻¹). The Tmax of NDNB-SMEDDS was prolonged by an extra 1 hour (3 hours vs 2 hours) compared to the soft capsule. Reasoning: The increased Cmax indicates a higher peak plasma concentration, while the prolonged Tmax suggests a sustained release or absorption profile, both contributing to enhanced and potentially more prolonged systemic exposure to nintedanib.
Source Paragraph: The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of nintedanib and the pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Figure 6 and Table 7. The plasma concentration of the NDNB- SMEDDS was significantly higher than the nintedanib soft capsule almost at each time point. The Cmax of the nintedanib soft capsule was 2.651±0.290 µg·mL¯¹, while that of the NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 2.3-fold (6.084±0.591 µg·mL¯¹) compared with nintedanib soft capsule. The AUC was substantially enhanced by 2.5-fold in the NDNB- SMEDDS group compared with the nintedanib soft capsule group (30.473 µg·h·mL¯¹ of NDNB-SMEDDS vs 12.706 µg·h·mL¯¹ of nintedanib soft capsule, P<0.01). This result is consistent with that of the closed-loop Doluisio method, wherein the Fabs of the NDNB-SMEDDS-treated group increased by 2.6 times in intestinal circulation. These results indicate that NDNB-SMEDDS could improve the absorption of the drug in vivo by potentially enhancing the permeability of the drug in the intestine. Furthermore, Tmax of NDNB- SMEDDS was prolonged for extra 1 hr compared with nintedanib soft capsule (2 hrs vs 3 hrs), indicating that SMEDDS could keep the drug in circulation to enhance the absorption rate in vivo.
