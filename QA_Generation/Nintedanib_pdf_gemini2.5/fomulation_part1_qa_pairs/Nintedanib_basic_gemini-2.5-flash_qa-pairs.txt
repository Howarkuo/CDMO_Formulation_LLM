=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS ===

SUMMARY:
This study investigated enteric polymer-based amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) to enhance the oral absorption of nintedanib, a weakly basic drug with low oral bioavailability due to pH-induced precipitation in the small intestine. Four pH-dependent soluble polymers (HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, and Eudragit L100) were evaluated. The findings demonstrated that these polymers significantly increased nintedanib's solubility and maintained supersaturation in a concentration-dependent manner, with Eudragit L100 showing the best performance. ASDs prepared via solvent evaporation converted nintedanib to an amorphous state, confirmed by PXRD and DSC, and exhibited strong drug-polymer interactions via hydrogen bonding, as shown by FT-IR. In vitro pH shift dissolution studies revealed that Eudragit L100-ASDs provided excellent acid resistance and inhibited precipitation. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that Eudragit L100-ASD significantly improved the relative oral bioavailability by 245% and prolonged the mean retention time, indicating a sustained plasma profile. The ASDs also maintained physical stability under high temperature and humidity conditions.

Q: 1. What is the primary challenge limiting the oral bioavailability of weakly basic drugs like nintedanib?
A & Reasoning: The primary challenge limiting the oral bioavailability of weakly basic drugs like nintedanib is pH-induced crystallization in the small intestine. This occurs because nintedanib, being a weakly basic drug, is easily soluble in acidic stomach conditions but tends to precipitate or recrystallize as the pH increases in the intestinal tract, which is the main site of drug absorption.
Source Paragraph: The pH-induced crystallization of weakly basic drugs in the small intestine limits oral bioavailability. In this study, we investigated the solubilization and inhibitory effects on nintedanib in the presence of enteric polymers (HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, and Eudragit L100). These polymers provided maintenance of supersaturation by increasing the solubility of nintedanib in PBS 6.8 in a concentration-dependent manner, and the improved ranking was as follows: Eudragit L100 > Eudragit L100 55 > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS LG. After being formulated into amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) by a solvent evaporation method, the drug exhibited an amorphous state. The pH shift dissolution results of polymer-ASDs demonstrated that four polymers could effectively maintain the drug supersaturation even at the lowest ratio of nintedanib and polymer (1:1, w/w). Eudragit L100-ASD could provide both acid resistance and the favorable mitigation of crystallization in GIF. In comparison to the coarse drug, the relative bioavailability of Eudragit L100-ASD was 245% after oral administration in rats, and Tmax was markedly delayed from 2.8 ± 0.4 h to 5.3 ± 2.7 h. Our findings indicate that enteric ASDs are an effective strategy to increase the intestinal absorption of nintedanib by improving physiologically generated supersaturation and subsequent crystallization.

Q: 2. Which enteric polymer demonstrated the highest capability for maintaining nintedanib supersaturation and increasing its solubility in PBS 6.8?
A & Reasoning: Eudragit L100 demonstrated the highest capability for maintaining nintedanib supersaturation and increasing its solubility in PBS 6.8. The ranking of improved solubility and supersaturation maintenance was Eudragit L100 > Eudragit L100 55 > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS LG.
Source Paragraph: In this study, we investigated the solubilization and inhibitory effects on nintedanib in the presence of enteric polymers (HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, and Eudragit L100). These polymers provided maintenance of supersaturation by increasing the solubility of nintedanib in PBS 6.8 in a concentration-dependent manner, and the improved ranking was as follows: Eudragit L100 > Eudragit L100 55 > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS LG.

Q: 3. What was the observed relative oral bioavailability of Eudragit L100-ASD compared to the coarse drug in rats?
A & Reasoning: The relative oral bioavailability of Eudragit L100-ASD was 245% compared to the coarse drug after oral administration in rats. This significant increase indicates that the enteric ASD formulation is an effective strategy to enhance the intestinal absorption of nintedanib.
Source Paragraph: In comparison to the coarse drug, the relative bioavailability of Eudragit L100-ASD was 245% after oral administration in rats, and Tmax was markedly delayed from 2.8 ± 0.4 h to 5.3 ± 2.7 h. Our findings indicate that enteric ASDs are an effective strategy to increase the intestinal absorption of nintedanib by improving physiologically generated supersaturation and subsequent crystallization.

Q: 4. What is the reported oral bioavailability of nintedanib when administered in soft capsules, and what are the contributing factors to this low bioavailability?
A & Reasoning: Nintedanib, when administered in soft capsules, shows low oral bioavailability of around 4.7%. This is attributed to its poorly aqueous solubility (circa 11.98 µg/mL) under pH 6.8, efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and first-pass metabolism.
Source Paragraph: Clinically, the weakly basic drug nintedanib is orally administered in soft capsules (Ofev® and Vargatef®) for twice-daily dosing. Although nintedanib is easily soluble in the stomach, it still shows low oral bioavailability (around 4.7%) due to poorly aqueous solubility (circa 11.98 µg/mL) under pH 6.8 [5], efflux by P-gp [6], and first-pass metabolism [7].

Q: 5. Describe the pH-dependent solubility profile of nintedanib.
A & Reasoning: Nintedanib displays a pH-dependent solubility profile where its solubility is nearly 5.0 mg/mL at pH values below 4.5, but it becomes insoluble at pH values above 6.0. This characteristic makes it prone to precipitation as it moves from the acidic stomach to the higher pH environment of the intestine.
Source Paragraph: Nintedanib, also known as BIBF1120, has the chemical name 1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid, 2,3-dihydro-3-[[[4-[methyl[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)acetyl]-amino] phenyl]amino] phenylmethylene]-2-oxo-,methyl ester, (3Z)-, ethanesulfonate [1]. It displays a pH-dependent solubility profile. The solubility of nintedanib at pH values below 4.5 is nearly 5.0 mg/mL but it is insoluble above 6.0 [5].

Q: 6. What is the primary purpose of using amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for poorly soluble drugs?
A & Reasoning: The primary purpose of using amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for poorly soluble drugs is to improve their oral bioavailability. ASDs achieve this by promoting temporary supersaturation and providing the driving force to enhance drug absorption, often utilizing hydrophilic polymers to improve wettability and dispersibility.
Source Paragraph: Amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) are one of the most frequently used methods for improving the oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs [10]. Hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyethyleneglycols (PEG), and Soluplus® (SOL) are commonly chosen for their better wettability and dispersibility to obtain immediate release characteristics in ASDs [11-14]. These carriers could promote temporary supersaturation and provide the driving force to enhance drug absorption [15].

Q: 7. Describe the solvent evaporation method used for preparing nintedanib amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs).
A & Reasoning: The solvent evaporation method involved dissolving nintedanib and various polymers (HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, or Eudragit L100) in methanol at different drug-to-polymer ratios (1:1, 1:3, or 1:5 w/w) with stirring. The organic solvent was then removed by rotary evaporation at 60 °C, and the resulting films were dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature. Finally, the dried films were ground with a mortar and pestle and passed through a 200-mesh sieve (75 µm) before storage.
Source Paragraph: ASDs of nintedanib with HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit® L100 55, or Eudragit® L100 were prepared using a solvent evaporation method, as described previously, with a slight modification [27]. Briefly, nintedanib and different polymers in different ratios (1:1, 1:3, or 1:5, w/w, drug: polymer) were dissolved in methanol by stirring. The organic solvents were removed by rotary evaporation at 60 °C. The obtained films were dried overnight under a vacuum at room temperature. After being ground with a mortar and pestle, the ASDs were forcibly passed through a 200-mesh sieve (75 µm). The resulting ASD powders were stored in a desiccator at ambient temperature until analysis.

Q: 8. What were the equilibrium solubility and apparent n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log D) of nintedanib at pH 1.2 and pH 6.8?
A & Reasoning: The maximum equilibrium solubility of nintedanib was 67.7 ± 1.2 mg/mL in pH 1.2 simulated gastric fluid (SGF). At pH 6.8, the solubility gradually decreased to 26.8 ± 1.6 µg/mL. The apparent n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log D) was -0.62 ± 0.02 at pH 1.2 and 2.64 ± 0.02 at pH 6.8, indicating that nintedanib is more lipophilic in a neutral environment than in an acidic one.
Source Paragraph: The equilibrium solubility and apparent n-octanol/water partition coefficient of a drug in the GI tract are the key parameters that affect drug absorption. As shown in Figure 2, the maximum solubility was 67.7 ± 1.2 mg/mL in pH 1.2 SGF. Sharply decreased solubility of nintedanib was observed when the pH value of the solvent ranged from 1.2 to 5.5. As the pH increased from 5.5 to 7.4, the drug solubility gradually decreased to 26.8 ± 1.6 µg/mL and 3.8 ± 0.2 µg/mL, respectively. The solubility changes with pH value indicated the pH-dependent solubility of nintedanib. On the contrary, the apparent n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log D = 2.64 ± 0.02) in the pH 6.8 medium was higher than that (log D = −0.62 ± 0.02) in the pH 1.2 medium, indicating that nintedanib was more lipophilic in the neutral environment than in the acidic environment.

Q: 9. How did the enteric polymers affect the apparent solubility of nintedanib in pH 6.8 PBS buffer, and what was the extent of improvement for Eudragit L100 at 0.1% (w/v)?
A & Reasoning: The enteric polymers significantly increased the apparent solubility of nintedanib in pH 6.8 PBS buffer in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.001). Specifically, at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v), Eudragit L100 elevated nintedanib's drug solubility by 39.0-fold compared to the pH 6.8 buffer without polymers. This improvement was attributed to the interaction between the enteric polymers and the drug, rather than a significant change in the pH of the environment.
Source Paragraph: The effect of different polymers on the solubility of nintedanib is shown in Figure 3a. The addition of enteric polymers in pH 6.8 PBS buffer ranging from 0.1% to 1% (w/v) significantly increased the apparent solubility of nintedanib in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.001). Compared to pH 6.8 buffer without polymers, HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, and Eudragit L100 at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) elevated drug solubility 2.6-, 2.9-, 32.5-, and 39.0-fold, respectively. At the concentration of 0.5%, Eudragit L100 increased the drug solubility 6.4-, 6.0-, and 1.3-fold in comparison with HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, and Eudragit L100 55, respectively. HPMCAS LG presented a similar increase as HPMCAS MG (p > 0.05). Eudragit L100 and L100 55 had similar potential to solubilize nintedanib, while Eudragit L100 showed stronger solubilization (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Compared to Eudragit L100 and L100 55, the improvement in the drug solubility was more dependent on the concentration gradient of HPMCAS LG and MG (p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 3b, the pH value of the corresponding medium slightly decreased with the additional content of polymers. However, the pH values were still around 6.0 at a 1.0% polymer concentration. These data indicated that the interaction between the enteric polymers and the drug improved the solubility of nintedanib, other than changing the pH value of the environment.

Q: 10. How does the succinoyl substituent level in HPMCAS polymers influence their ability to inhibit nintedanib crystallization?
A & Reasoning: The ability of HPMCAS polymers to inhibit nintedanib crystallization strongly depends on their succinoyl substituent level. An increase in the succinoyl substituent ratio (e.g., HPMCAS LG with 0.37 compared to HPMCAS MG with 0.26) strongly affects the hydrophilicity of the polymer due to the ionization of carboxylic acid, which in turn reduces the inhibition efficiency for drug precipitation. This means a higher succinoyl level leads to less effective crystallization inhibition.
Source Paragraph: The influences of the four enteric polymers on the supersaturation kinetics of nintedanib were consistent with the impacts on drug solubility. HPMCAS LG and Eudragit L100 55 dissolved at pH > 5.5, while both HPMCAS MG and Eudragit L100 dissolved at pH > 6.0, with pH-dependent solubility. As the pH values of drug-polymer solutions were weakly affected (Figure 3b), the polymer-induced improvement in solubility was not derived from the formation of soluble salt, but rather from a strong interaction between the drug and polymers. Polymer structure, especially the functional groups, has been reported to affect the preservation of the supersaturated state [31]. HPMCAS LG and HPMCAS MG possess both hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic groups. It was found that the ability of HPMCAS to inhibit drug crystallization strongly depended on the succinoyl substituent level in HPMCAS [32]. The increase in the succinoyl substituent ratio of HPMCAS (LG: 0.37, MG: 0.26, average number/glucose ring unit), which strongly affected the hydrophilicity of the polymer due to the ionization of carboxylic acid, reduced the inhibition efficiency for drug precipitation [32]. Adsorption of the polymers' hydrophobic groups onto the surface of hydrophobic nintedanib could suppress the crystal growth of the drug [33,34]. Similarly, the dependence on the hydrophobicity among HPMCAS and Eudragit might elucidate the inhibitory effects on precipitation. Eudragit L100 55 is a copolymer of methacrylic acid (MA) and ethyl acrylate (EA) (1:1), while Eudragit L100 has the same ratio between MA and methyl methacrylate (MMA) (1:1). Eudragit L100, with more hydrophobic MMA monomers, is more hydrophobic than Eudragit L100 55 [33]. The increased hydrophobicity of Eudragit polymers elevated the inhibition of recrystallization, which is in agreement with a reported study [35].

Q: 11. How did Eudragit L100 perform in inhibiting nintedanib crystallization compared to other polymers in the supersaturation solution?
A & Reasoning: Eudragit L100 demonstrated the best inhibition of nintedanib precipitation. It could prevent crystallization at 5 minutes, and the number of nintedanib crystals observed at 360 minutes was significantly less than with HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, or Eudragit L100 55, which only decreased the number of crystals but did not prevent their initial appearance at 5 minutes.
Source Paragraph: Micro-sized particles formed in the supersaturation solution were detected by polarized light microscopy. As shown in Figure 5, continuous precipitation of nintedanib was observed within 360 min. However, the rate of crystallization differed among different groups. Precipitation of nintedanib particles appeared 5 min after the addition of drug solution in the blank pH 6.8 PBS buffer, and a large number of crystals with a growing size precipitated within 60 min. Although the crystallization of nintedanib still appeared at 5 min, the number of crystals decreased sharply at all specified times in the presence of HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, or Eudragit L100 55. Eudragit L100 could prevent crystallization at 5 min, and the number of nintedanib crystals presented in 360 min was less than that in the other three polymers, indicating the best inhibition of nintedanib precipitation. The trend of maintaining supersaturation was the same as the supersaturation kinetics of the concentration-time profiles.

Q: 12. What did Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) analysis reveal about the physical state of nintedanib in the prepared ASDs?
A & Reasoning: PXRD analysis revealed that nintedanib in the prepared ASDs was converted from a crystalline state to an amorphous form. This was evidenced by the disappearance of the sharp diffraction peaks characteristic of crystalline nintedanib (at 2θ angles of 11.55°, 17.38°, 18.77°, 19.02°, and 19.95°) and the presence of a halo pattern, similar to the amorphous polymers.
Source Paragraph: The PXRD patterns for nintedanib, polymers, physical mixtures, and ASDs in Figure 7 indicate changes in the crystalline structure of the initial substance. The diffractograms of nintedanib presented distinctive peaks at 2θ angles of 11.55°, 17.38°, 18.77°, 19.02°, and 19.95°, which revealed its crystalline state. The PXRD spectra of all polymers exhibited a halo pattern, indicating their amorphous state. For physical mixtures, a series of diffraction peaks superimposed with nintedanib and some diffraction peaks showed a slight reduction due to the dilution of polymers. On the contrary, the sharp diffraction peaks of nintedanib disappeared in all ASDs, demonstrating that nintedanib converted from a crystalline state to an amorphous form.

Q: 13. What did Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicate about the state of nintedanib in the ASDs?
A & Reasoning: DSC analysis indicated that nintedanib in the ASDs was converted from a crystalline state to an amorphous state and was miscible with the polymers. This was confirmed by the absence of the characteristic melting peak of crystalline nintedanib (at 134 °C) and its sharp endothermic peak (at 305 °C) in the DSC curves of all ASD formulations.
Source Paragraph: Figure 8 shows the thermal behaviors of nintedanib, polymers, physical mixtures, and ASDs. Nintedanib powder exhibited a small melting peak at 134 °C and a sharp and intense endothermic peak at 305 °C, indicating that the drug existed in a crystalline form, as previously reported [9]. The physical mixtures with HPMCAS LG or HPMCAS MG demonstrated an endothermic peak at 134 °C, whereas the endothermic peak at 305 °C disappeared, which might be attributed to the poor thermal stability of the physical mixtures as HPMCAS degraded above 250 °C [36]. The mixtures of nintedanib with Eudragit L100 55 or Eudragit L100 displayed a shift in endothermic peak to a slightly lower temperature of 300 °C, which might be due to the solvent effect of the molten polymer [37]. No endothermic peaks were detected in all ASDs, suggesting that nintedanib was miscible with the four polymers and converted from the crystalline state to an amorphous state.

Q: 14. What type of molecular interactions were identified between nintedanib and the enteric polymers in the ASDs, and how were they confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy?
A & Reasoning: Hydrogen bonding interactions were identified between nintedanib and the enteric polymers. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed these interactions through several changes: for HPMCAS-ASDs, the disappearance of the nintedanib C=O stretching peak at 1711 cm¯¹, broadening of other C=O peaks (1652 cm¯¹, 1611 cm¯¹), and a significant decrease in the N-H stretching peak (3414 cm¯¹), along with slight shifts in the polymer's C=O peaks. For Eudragit-ASDs, the C=O stretching bands at 1711 cm¯¹ and 1652 cm¯¹ and the N–H stretching peak at 3414 cm¯¹ of nintedanib disappeared, while the C=O peaks of Eudragit polymers became weaker and blue-shifted. These spectral changes are indicative of hydrogen bond formation between the N-H bond of nintedanib and the carbonyl groups of the polymers, which facilitates the inhibition of drug crystallization and precipitation.
Source Paragraph: FT-IR analysis was performed for the possible molecular interactions between the drug and polymers. The IR spectra of nintedanib, polymers, PMs, and ASDs are depicted in Figure 9. Characteristic peaks of nintedanib appeared at 3414 cm¯¹ (N–H stretch), 1711 cm¯¹ (C=O stretch, ester), 1652 cm¯¹ (C=O stretch, secondary amide), and 1611 cm-1 (C=O stretch, tertiary amide). Physical mixtures of nintedanib with HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, or Eudragit L100 55 exhibited both the characteristic peaks of the drug and respective polymer, except Eudragit L100. The spectra of ASDs showed significant changes. For the ASD formulated by HPMCAS LG, the C=O stretching peak at 1711 cm-1 disappeared, and the C=O stretching (1652 cm¯¹ and 1611 cm¯¹) tended to broaden. The N-H stretching peak of nintedanib decreased significantly (Figure 9a). Moreover, the C=O stretching peak of HPMCAS LG at 1747 cm¯¹ shifted slightly to 1740 cm¯¹. The spectrum of HPMCAS MG-ASD was similar to that of HPMCAS LG-ASD, with a slight shift in the characteristic peak of the polymer from 1745 cm¯¹ to 1741 cm¯¹ (Figure 9b). These changes indicated the formation of H-bonds between the HPMCAS carbonyl group and the N-H bond in the nintedanib. In ASDs prepared with Eudragit L100 55 or Eudragit L100, the C=O stretching bands at 1711 cm¯¹ and 1652 cm¯¹ in nintedanib disappeared, along with the N–H stretching peak at 3414 cm¯¹. The C=O of Eudragit L100 55 (1735 cm¯¹) and Eudragit L100 (1725 cm¯¹) became weak, and the C=O stretching of Eudragit L100 55 at 1703 cm-1 blue-shifted to 1699 cm-1 (Figure 9c,d). These findings in the Eudragit-ASDs' FT-IR spectra also suggested the H-bonding interactions between the N-H bond of nintedanib and the carbonyl group of Eudragit L100 55 or Eudragit L100. In addition, the peak at 1611 cm¯¹, as assigned to the stretching of C=O in the nintedanib band, weakened in Eudragit L100-ASD compared to Eudragit L100 55–ASD, implying that Eudragit L100 might provide stronger interactions with the drug. The contribution of hydrogen bonding between the drug and the enteric polymers might facilitate the inhibition of drug crystallization and precipitation [34,38].

Q: 15. How did HPMCAS ASDs perform in pH shift dissolution studies, particularly regarding drug precipitation upon pH change?
A & Reasoning: In pH shift dissolution studies, HPMCAS ASDs (both LG and MG) showed that more than 80% of nintedanib dissolved in SGF within 5 minutes. However, when the pH of the medium shifted to 6.8 (SIF), the dissolved drug concentration slightly decreased, indicating that the released drug precipitated. Despite this, HPMCAS polymers inhibited the precipitation of nintedanib due to drug-polymer interactions, rather than solely through ASD formation, and HPMCAS ASDs maintained supersaturation in pH 6.8 PBS, although without marked significance except for HPMCAS MG-ASDs at a 1:1 ratio.
Source Paragraph: Dissolution behaviors of ASDs with different ratios of nintedanib (50 mg) and polymers were examined in SGF for 120 min and then in SIF for 240 min. As depicted in Figure 10a-d, the type and content of enteric polymer largely influenced the drug dissolution rate. For HPMCAS (both LG and MG), more than 80% and 86% of nintedanib in ASDs was dissolved in SGF at 5 min and 120 min, while more than 94% of nintedanib was dissolved for all physical mixtures. Although there was no obvious retardation with HPMCAS LG and MG in drug release in SGF, the drug release of HPMCAS LG 1:3, 1:5, and MG 1:5 ASDs presented significantly lower values than that of the corresponding ratios of physical mixtures (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). A similar observation was made by Liu et al. [39]. When the pH of the medium changed to 6.8, the dissolved concentration of the drug slightly decreased, suggesting that the released drug precipitated (Figure 10a,b). Although the precipitates continued to redissolve, the drug concentration at 240 min in SIF still was lower than in SGF. In addition, HPMCAS LG-ASDs presented similar dissolution profiles to HPMCAS MG-ASDs at the ratios of nintedanib and polymers of 1:1 and 1:5 (w/w). Interestingly, HPMCAS ASDs exhibited a superior trend to maintain the supersaturation of nintedanib in pH 6.8 PBS but without marked significance, except for HPMCAS MG-ASDs at the ratio of 1:1 (Figure 10b). These results demonstrated that HPMCAS polymers inhibited the precipitation of weakly alkaline nintedanib due to the interaction of the drug and the polymers instead of the formation of ASDs, which coincides with a previous report [36].

Q: 16. Which Eudragit L100 ASD formulation ratio demonstrated the best acid resistance and supersaturation maintenance in pH shift dissolution studies?
A & Reasoning: The Eudragit L100-ASD (1:5) formulation demonstrated the best acid resistance and superior maintenance of nintedanib supersaturation in pH 6.8 PBS. It released approximately 7% of nintedanib at 120 minutes in SGF, indicating excellent stomach protection, and then released 80% after 30 minutes upon switching to SIF, maintaining a higher level of drug concentration compared to other ratios.
Source Paragraph: The drug release profiles of Eudragit-PMs were similar to those of HPMCAS–PMs (Figure 10c,d). Compared to the initial concentration in SGF, the drug concentration tended to decrease with time in SIF. The release profiles of Eudragit–ASDs were different from the physical mixtures. The acid resistance of Eudragit–ASDs significantly increased in comparison with the corresponding ratio of Eudragit–PMs (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). The drug release from the Eudragit–ASDs in SGF also markedly declined with the ratio of polymer (p < 0.001). As illustrated in Figure 10c, the drug dissolution percentages in the Eudragit L100 55–ASD (1:3, w/w) group were significantly higher than those of the Eudragit L100 55–ASD (1:1) group at 150 min and 180 min in SIF (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001, Figure 10c). As for the 1:5 group, approximately 65% of the drug dissolved at 120 min, indicating that the larger ratio of Eudragit L100 55 further enhanced the anti-acid effect of the formulated ASD. Moreover, nintedanib in Eudragit L100 55–ASD (1:5) could dissolve and maintain a higher level of drug concentration at all time points compared to that of ASD (1:1) (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Compared to the PM groups, ASDs with the highest ratio of polymer (1:5) exhibited superior maintenance of nintedanib supersaturation in pH 6.8 PBS (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001). As for the ASDs with ratios of 1:1 and 1:3, an enhanced trend in the inhibition of drug precipitation could be observed, while only the group (1:1) at 240 min showed significance (p < 0.001). Compared to the related ratio of the Eudragit L100-PM group, the drug release levels in SIF were significantly improved at 240 min, 300 min, and 360 min (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) for the 1:3 ASD group and at 300 min and 360 min (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) for the 1:5 ASD group. Circa 32% of nintedanib in Eudragit L100–ASD (1:3) dissolved at 120 min, which significantly retarded drug release in comparison to the 1:1 group (p < 0.001), and the drug release percentages in pH 6.8 PBS buffer were significantly higher than those in the 1:1 group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). The Eudragit L100-ASD (1:5) released approximately 7% of nintedanib at 120 min in SGF and 80% after 30 min and switched to SIF, indicating that Eudragit L100 demonstrated excellent stomach protection. The difference in dissolution rates in the Eudragit L100 55–ASD and L100–ASD in SGF might be attributed to the greater ionization rate of L100 55 due to its relatively low hydrophobicity [35].

Q: 17. How was the physical stability of the ASDs evaluated, and what were the key findings?
A & Reasoning: The physical stability of the ASDs was evaluated using a stress test under high humidity (92.5% ± 5%) and high temperature (60 °C ± 1 °C) for 10 days. Key findings included that PXRD diffraction patterns of the ASDs remained amorphous, with no detection of nintedanib diffraction peaks, and the dissolution profiles after 10 days showed similarity factors (f2) between 64 and 87 (all > 50) compared to initial profiles. These results confirmed that all four polymers provided physically stable amorphous nintedanib.
Source Paragraph: The physical stability of solid dispersions was evaluated by a stress test under 92.5% ± 5% humidity and 60 °C ± 1 °C temperature. As presented in Figure 11, the PXRD diffraction diagrams of the ASDs after the stability test were similar to the initial systems (Figure 7). No diffraction peak of nintedanib was detected, confirming that the drug in all four ASDs still existed in an amorphous state. Comparing the dissolution profile at 10 days with that at 0 days (Figure 12), the values of the f2 similarity factors were between 64 and 87, demonstrating the dissolution profile similarities (f2 > 50) among all the formulations. These results showed that using HPMCAS LG, HPMCAS MG, Eudragit L100 55, and Eudragit L100 as a matrix provided an amorphous form of nintedanib and it remained physically stable.

Q: 18. What were the key pharmacokinetic parameter changes observed for Eudragit L100-ASD compared to crystalline nintedanib in rats?
A & Reasoning: For Eudragit L100-ASD in rats, the Tmax was markedly delayed from 2.8 ± 0.4 h to 5.3 ± 2.7 h (p < 0.05), indicating gastric acid resistance and delayed drug release. The AUC0–24h significantly increased from 1107.6 ± 292.3 ng/mL·h for nintedanib to 2710.6 ± 1479.4 ng/mL·h for Eudragit L100-ASD (p < 0.05), resulting in a 245% relative oral bioavailability. The Mean Retention Time (MRT) also significantly increased (p < 0.01), suggesting an extended absorption period and a sustained plasma profile.
Source Paragraph: The Eudragit L100–ASD was further chosen to investigate the effect of enteric polymers on the absorption of the weakly alkaline nintedanib. The plasma concentration-time profiles and main pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Figure 13 and Table 2, respectively. For the Eudragit L100-ASD group, the plasma concentration was not detected until 2 h. Compared to the nintedanib group (2.8 ± 0.4 h), the peak plasma concentration was achieved at 5.3 ± 2.7 h. The Tmax markedly increased (p < 0.05), indicating that Eudragit L100–ASD could resist gastric acid and delay the drug release in the GIT. The mean Cmax for Eudragit L100–ASD (370.0 ± 159.6 ng/mL) was 1.5–fold higher than that of nintedanib (248.3 ± 70.4 ng/mL), but the lack of marked difference (p > 0.05) might be due to the high individual variation among rats. The AUC0–24h for Eudragit L100–ASD (2710.6 ± 1479.4 ng/mL.h) was significantly greater than that obtained with nintedanib (1107.6 ± 292.3 ng/mL·h) (p < 0.05), indicating that the ASD formulation significantly improved the oral bioavailability (Frel = 245%). No significant differences were observed for t1/2 values of Eudragit L100–ASD and nintedanib. However, the MRT of Eudragit L100-ASD significantly increased compared to the crystalline drug (p < 0.01), indicating that the enteric polymer extended the absorption period and provided a sustained plasma profile.

Q: 19. What are the primary mechanisms proposed for the enhanced bioavailability of nintedanib by Eudragit L100-ASD?
A & Reasoning: The primary mechanisms for enhanced bioavailability include: (1) amorphous conversion of crystalline nintedanib, which improves its solubility and facilitates dissolution in the intestinal fluid; (2) the Eudragit L100 polymer's ability to inhibit precipitation and recrystallization of the dissolved drug, effectively maintaining a supersaturated state; and (3) the sustained supersaturation providing a high energy state that drives a high concentration gradient, promoting drug transport across the intestinal membrane and enhancing oral absorption.
Source Paragraph: The reasons for the bioavailability enhancement by Eudragit L100–ASD are listed as follows: (1) the amorphous conversion of crystalline nintedanib improved the solubility of the weakly alkaline drug and facilitated dissolution in the intestinal fluid [12]; (2) the polymer Eudragit L100 inhibited the precipitation and recrystallization of the dissolved drug, and effectively maintained the state of drug supersaturation; (3) the maintenance of the supersaturation state could provide high energy, which maintained a high concentration gradient state to drive the drug to be transported across the intestinal membrane and promoted oral drug absorption [41]. Although the improved bioavailability was comparable to that of reported novel formulations [8,9], the excellent maintenance of supersaturation in the neutral medium in vitro only contributed to a limited augmentation, suggesting that other issues should be considered for further improvement [6,7]. Large inter-individual variation in the plasma concentration of nintedanib was also observed for the Eudragit L100-ASD group. As the amorphous drug was distributed throughout the Eudragit L100 matrix, the dissolution rate of the polymer in the gastrointestinal fluid controlled the drug dissolution. The intrinsic dissolution characteristics of Eudragit L100 and the relatively low volume of intestinal fluids might contribute to preventing the formation of high drug concentrations in the lumen, as demonstrated in the delayed Tmax and prolonged MRT (Table 2). Individual differences, such as the pH value and volume of intestinal fluid, as well as the metabolism enzymes and transporters, influenced the drug absorption of Eudragit L100-ASD in vivo [42].

Q: 20. What potential issues or limitations were identified regarding the Eudragit L100-ASD formulation and its in vivo performance?
A & Reasoning: Potential issues identified include: (1) the excellent maintenance of supersaturation in vitro in neutral medium only contributed to a limited augmentation in vivo, suggesting other factors need consideration for further improvement; (2) large inter-individual variation in plasma nintedanib concentration was observed for the Eudragit L100-ASD group; (3) the dissolution rate of the polymer in the gastrointestinal fluid controlled drug dissolution, potentially preventing high drug concentrations in the lumen due to the intrinsic dissolution characteristics of Eudragit L100 and low intestinal fluid volume, leading to delayed Tmax and prolonged MRT; and (4) individual differences in factors like pH, intestinal fluid volume, metabolism enzymes, and transporters influenced in vivo drug absorption.
