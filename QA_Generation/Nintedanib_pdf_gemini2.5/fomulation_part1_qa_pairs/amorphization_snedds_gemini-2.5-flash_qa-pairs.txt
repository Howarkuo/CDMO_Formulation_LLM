=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS ===

SUMMARY:
This study successfully improved the oral absorption of nintedanib (NTD), a 'brick dust' drug with low bioavailability, by combining co-amorphization with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) containing 2% HPMCP-50. The co-amorphization disrupted NTD's high crystallinity, significantly increasing its solubility in various vehicles and the SNEDDS formulation. The SNEDDS formulation with HPMCP-50 maintained supersaturation and enhanced dissolution under small intestinal conditions. In vivo studies in rats demonstrated that the 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS significantly increased NTD plasma concentrations and AUC (1.52 times higher than Ofev®) and reduced inter-individual variability, outperforming the marketed Ofev® formulation.

Q: 1. What are the primary challenges associated with the oral absorption of nintedanib (NTD) and how was the formulation strategy designed to address them?
A & Reasoning: The primary challenges for NTD's oral absorption are its classification as a 'brick dust' drug with a high melting point, resulting in low and highly variable oral bioavailability. The formulation strategy involved preparing a SNEDDS formulation containing an amorphous NTD-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) complex with 2% HPMCP-50. This approach aimed to disrupt the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA, thereby increasing solubility and improving dissolution behavior, particularly under small intestinal conditions.
Source Paragraph: Nintedanib (NTD), approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and advanced non-small cell lung cancer, is one of brick dusts with high melting point. Although NTD has been marketed as Ofev®, a soft capsule of NTD ethanesulfonate (NTD-ESA) suspended in oil components, the oral bioavailability is quite low and highly variable. To improve the oral absorption behavior of NTD, we prepared SNEDDS formulation containing NTD-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) complex with 2% HPMCP-50. CSA disrupted the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA and the formed complex, NTD-CSA, was found to be amorphous by DSC and XRPD. NTD-CSA provided solubilities in various vehicles much higher than NTD-ESA. Under the gastric luminal condition, NTD-CSA SNEDDS with or without 2% HPMCP-50 and NTD-CSA powder indicated very good dissolution of NTD from early time periods, while NTD was gradually dissolved until around 60 min from NTD-ESA and Ofev®. Under the small intestinal luminal condition, in contrast, both NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulations almost completely dissolved NTD throughout the experiments, while Ofev®, NTD-CSA, and NTD-ESA exhibited a very poor dissolution of NTD. In the in vivo absorption study, NTD-CSA SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50 significantly improved NTD ab-sorption and reduced the inter-individual variation in oral absorption behavior compared with Ofev®.

Q: 2. What is the reported oral bioavailability of Ofev® and what are the contributing factors to its low value and high variability?
A & Reasoning: The oral bioavailability (BA) of NTD after oral dosing of Ofev® is around 4.7%. The low BA and high variability (CV ranged from 46 to 83%) are attributed to efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), substantial first-pass metabolism via the small intestine/liver, and poor solubility of NTD-ESA, which is highly crystalline with a melting point of 305°C and low solubility in aqueous and lipoidal vehicles.
Source Paragraph: Nintedanib (NTD) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking the kinase activity of various receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)- and -ẞ, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3 (Hilberg et al., 2008; Roth et al., 2009) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including Fms-like tyrosine-protein kinase 3 (FLT-3) and ret proto-oncogene (RET) (NDA review, FDA, 2014). Therefore, NTD was approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Package insert of Ofev®, 2022; Summary of product characteristics, Ofev®, 2018) and for the use in combination with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma (Summary of product characteristics, Ofev®, 2018). NTD has been marketed as Ofev®, which is the soft capsule of NTD ethanesulfonate (NTD-ESA) suspended in triglyceride, hard fat, lecithin, gelatin, glyc-erin, titanium oxide, red ferric oxide, and yellow ferric oxide (NDA re-view, FDA, 2014). The bioavailability (BA) of NTD after oral dosing of Ofev® was around 4.7% (Dallinger et al., 2016), for which the reasons were suggested to be the efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Luedtke et al., 2018) and substantial first-pass metabolism via small intestine/liver (Summary of product characteristics, Ofev®, 2018). Since a high-fat meal tended to increase the oral absorption of NTD (Wind et al., 2019), the poor solubility of NTD would also be one of the reasons for its low BA. NTD-ESA is also classified into BCS class II or IV (Wind et al., 2019). Furthermore, a relatively large inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic behavior as shown in coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 46 to 83% is thought to be due to the variation in ab-sorption process (Wind et al., 2019). Considering that the formulation type of Ofev® is an oil suspension, the oral absorption of NTD might be improved by some formulations that could increase the solubility of NTD. NTD-ESA is highly crystalline with 305°C of melting point (Roth et al., 2015 and Table 1) and its solubility in aqueous vehicle under neutral or basic pH and several lipoidal vehicles is quite low (Wind et al., 2019 and Table 2), indicating that NTD-ESA should be one of com-pounds called as "brick dust".

Q: 3. What are the physicochemical characteristics of NTD-ESA that classify it as a 'brick dust' compound?
A & Reasoning: NTD-ESA is classified as a 'brick dust' compound due to its highly crystalline nature, a high melting point of 305°C, and very low solubility in aqueous vehicles under neutral or basic pH, as well as in several lipoidal vehicles.
Source Paragraph: NTD-ESA is highly crystalline with 305°C of melting point (Roth et al., 2015 and Table 1) and its solubility in aqueous vehicle under neutral or basic pH and several lipoidal vehicles is quite low (Wind et al., 2019 and Table 2), indicating that NTD-ESA should be one of com-pounds called as "brick dust".

Q: 4. What prior research findings supported the current study's strategy for improving the bioavailability of brick dust compounds?
A & Reasoning: Prior research showed that complex formation with a counter ion led to amorphization and extensively improved solubility of brick dust-like compounds (rebamipide, mebendazole). While co-amorphous complex powders alone did not improve bioavailability, SNEDDS formulations containing these complexes, especially with added polymers, significantly enhanced oral absorption. This suggested that improving solubility through co-amorphization and preparing SNEDDS with a polymer is a promising strategy for brick dust compounds.
Source Paragraph: We have recently reported that the complex formation with some counter ion resulted in the amorphization of a brick dust-like compound such as rebamipide (Okawa et al., 2021) and mebendazole (Sumimoto et al., 2022), and the co-amorphous complex of each compound exten-sively improved the solubility in water and various lipoidal vehicles. Although the oral administration of the co-amorphous complex powders did not lead to the improvement of BA, SNEDDS formulations containing the co-amorphous complex significantly improved the oral absorption of rebamipide or mebendazole. Furthermore, the addition of some polymer into the SNEDDS formulation led to the further improvement of BA for both brick-dust like compounds (Okawa et al., 2021; Sumimoto et al., 2022). Our previous results suggested that "the improvement of solu-bility by co-amorphization and the preparation of SNEDDS formulation with some polymer for the co-amorphous complex" would be a prom-ising strategy to overcome the difficulty for preparing the formulations of brick dust-like compounds. In the current study, we aimed to improve the BA of NTD, a brick dust, by applying our strategy with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) or 2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA) as a counter ion, and successfully improved the solubility of NTD in various lipoidal vehicles by the co-amorphous formation with CSA, and

Q: 5. What specific excipients were chosen for the SNEDDS formulation and what was the rationale for their selection?
A & Reasoning: The SNEDDS formulation utilized Capryol 90 as an oil component and Transcutol P as a cosolvent, based on their ability to dissolve NTD-ESA and NTD-CSA. Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH40 were also used. HPMCP-50 was selected as a polymer to maintain supersaturation, as previous studies showed it provided a larger area of nanoemulsion formation and good performance for brick dust-like drugs.
Source Paragraph: Nintedanib ethanesulfonate (NTD-ESA) (Fig. 1 and Table 1) and Ofev® were kindly supplied by Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Ethanesulfonic acid (ESA), 2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) (Fig. 1 and Table 1), and albenda-zole, an internal standard, were purchased from Tokyo Chemical In-dustry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). HPMCP-50 was kindly supplied by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo). Transcutol P was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH40 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Capryol 90 was kindly supplied from CBC Co., Ltd. (Tokyo). Olive oil and Castor oil were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto) and FUJIFILM Wako pure chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Other chemicals were analytical grade commercial products.

Q: 6. What was the optimal composition of the SNEDDS vehicle used in this study?
A & Reasoning: The optimal composition of the SNEDDS vehicle was Capryol 90: Cremophor EL: Transcutol P = 4:3:3 (w/w/w). This ratio was chosen based on previous results showing it provided a larger area of nanoemulsion formation and good performance for brick dust-like drugs in both in vitro and in vivo studies.
Source Paragraph: The solubilities of NTD-ESA (Table 2) and NTD-CSA (Table 3) in each excipient indicated that Capryol 90 and Transcutol P should be selected as an oil component and a cosolvent of SNEDDS, respectively. Further-more, since our previous results revealed that Capryol 90: Cremophor EL: Transcutol P = 4:3:3 (w/w/w) with or without HPMCP-50 pro-vided a larger area of nanoemulsion formation in the psuedo-ternary phase diagrams and the good performance for brick dust-like drugs in in vitro and in vivo studies (Okawa et al., 2021; Sumimoto et al., 2022), the composition was chosen to prepare the SNEDDS vehicle. To estimate the improvement of solubility of NTD in SNEDDS by each NTD-counter ion complex, SNEDDS vehicle was prepared first and then, each complex was put into the SNEDDS vehicle and its solubility was examined.

Q: 7. What was the solubility of NTD-ESA in pH6.5 FaSSIF and various lipoidal vehicles, and what does this indicate about its dissolution in the small intestine?
A & Reasoning: The solubility of NTD-ESA in pH6.5 FaSSIF was found to be only 12 µg/mL, and in various lipoidal vehicles, it was less than 1 mg/mL. This indicates significant difficulty in its dissolution in the small intestinal lumen, which is consistent with Ofev® being an oil suspension.
Source Paragraph: Since OfevⓇ has been marketed as a soft capsule of oil suspension of NTD-ESA (NDA review, FDA, 2014), we, first, examined the solubility of NTD-ESA in various aqueous and lipoidal vehicles (Table 2). Milligram-order solubilities were recognized for distilled water, pH3.9 acetate buffer and ethanol, but the solubility in pH6.5 FaSSIF was found to be only 12 µg/mL, indicating the difficulty in its dissolution in the small intestinal lumen. Furthermore, the solubilities in various lipoidal vehi-cles were found to be less than 1 mg/mL, convincing that Ofev® should be an oil suspension.

Q: 8. Why was 2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA) deemed less effective than (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) for forming a complex with NTD?
A & Reasoning: NSA was deemed less effective because, although it increased NTD solubility up to 20 µmol/mL at a 1:1 molar ratio, the solubility subsequently decreased. The interaction of NTD with NSA was limited, and NSA was not able to efficiently replace ESA. In contrast, CSA proportionally increased NTD solubility, forming a complex at a 100:107 molar ratio (NTD to CSA), and ESA was not detectable in the resulting NTD-CSA powder, indicating efficient replacement.
Source Paragraph: Next, the formation of the complex of NTD with NSA or CSA was examined in ethanol. When the added counter ion disrupts the high crystallinity of a brick dust, the solubility extensively increases over the solubility of brick dust crystalline in ethanol (Okawa et al., 2021; Sumimoto et al., 2022). As shown in Fig. 2 (A), NSA increased the sol-ubility of NTD until around 20 µmol/mL where NTD-NSA was formed at 1:1 molar ratio, but thereafter the solubility fell down to ca 12 µmol/ mL. Since the solubility of NTD-ESA is 2.41 µmol/mL, NSA improved the solubility of NTD, but the result indicated the interaction of NTD with NSA should be limited and NSA was not able to be replaced with ESA efficiently. In contrast, Fig. 2 (B) clearly indicated that CSA increased the solubility of NTD proportionally as CSA amount increased and the complex was found to be formed at the molar ratio of NTD to CSA, 100 : 107. Furthermore, ESA was not detectable by HPLC in the ethanol so-lution dissolving NTD-CSA powder, suggesting that ESA would have been almost completely replaced with CSA in forming the complex with NTD. Then, NTD-CSA complex was prepared at the molar ratio 100: 107 for further studies.

Q: 9. How significantly did the co-amorphization of NTD with CSA improve its solubility in pH6.5 FaSSIF and the SNEDDS vehicle compared to NTD-ESA?
A & Reasoning: The co-amorphization of NTD with CSA increased its solubility in pH6.5 FaSSIF by 3.7 times compared to NTD-ESA. Furthermore, its solubility in the SNEDDS vehicle was 15 times higher than that of NTD-ESA.
Source Paragraph: Then, the solubilities of NTD-CSA were examined in various aqueous and lipoidal vehicles (Table 3). NTD-CSA extensively improved the solubility of NTD in distilled water or pH3.9 acetate buffer. The solu-bility in pH6.5 FaSSIF, although still very low, also increased 3.7 times compared to that by NTD-ESA. As for the lipoidal vehicles, NTD solu-bility was largely improved in Capryol 90 and Transcutol P, and therefore, the solubility in SNEDDS vehicle was also 15 times higher than that by NTD-ESA.

Q: 10. What solid-state characterization methods were used to confirm the amorphization of NTD-CSA, and what was the underlying reason for CSA's effectiveness?
A & Reasoning: Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) were used to confirm the amorphization of NTD-CSA. NTD-ESA showed a large endothermic peak around 300°C and sharp diffraction peaks, indicating crystallinity. In contrast, NTD-CSA exhibited a 'hallo pattern' in both DSC and XRPD, confirming its amorphous state. CSA's effectiveness is attributed to its steric structure, which efficiently disrupted the crystal packing of NTD-ESA, leading to stable co-amorphization.
Source Paragraph: The solid states of NTD-CSA and NTD-ESA were examined by DSC (Fig. 3 (A)) and XRPD (Fig. 3 (B)). NTD-ESA provided a large endo-thermic peak around 300°C in DSC thermogram and many sharp diffraction peaks in XRPD pattern, which are very similar with those reported (Zhu et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022). In our previous study (Sumimoto et al., 2022), ESA formed the co-amorphous complex with mebendazole. However, NTD-ESA was confirmed to be crystalline with high melting point (Fig. 3). In contrast, both DSC and XRPD charts revealed a hallo pattern for NTD-CSA (Fig. 3 (A) and (B)), clearly indi-cating that NTD-CSA should be amorphous. The reason why only CSA has disrupted the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA would be as follows. Since the planarity and/or symmetry is considered to be an issue to be overcome to enhance the solubility of brick dust-like drugs (Ishikawa and Hashimoto, 2011), the steric structure of CSA as shown in Fig. 1 (D) would efficiently have disrupted the crystal packing of NTD-ESA and would have been stably co-amorphized with NTD.

Q: 11. What was the role of HPMCP-50 in the formulation, and how effective was it in maintaining NTD supersaturation?
A & Reasoning: HPMCP-50 was selected as a polymer to maintain the supersaturation of NTD. In a solvent shift method, HPMCP-50 was able to maintain NTD concentrations around five times higher than formulations without HPMCP-50 for 2 hours, suggesting its effectiveness as a precipitation inhibitor.
Source Paragraph: As a polymer to maintain the supersaturation of NTD, HPMCP-50 was selected and examined by solvent shift method, because HPMCP-50 kept the highest concentration of mebendazole, a basic drug, among 10 polymers and gave the sustained release property to the SNEDDS formulation of mebendazole-CSA complex (Sumimoto et al., 2022). As shown in Fig. 4, HPMCP-50 was able to maintain NTD con-centrations around five times higher than those without HPMCP-50 for 2 h, suggesting its possible usage as a precipitation inhibitor.

Q: 12. What was the impact of drug loading on the dissolution and stability of NTD-CSA in the SNEDDS vehicle?
A & Reasoning: At a higher loading dose of 34.80 mg NTD/g SNEDDS, the dissolved concentration of NTD decreased to around 20 mg/g SNEDDS. However, at a lower loading dose of 18 mg NTD/g SNEDDS, NTD was almost completely dissolved throughout the study. For SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50 at 20.15 mg NTD/g SNEDDS, the concentration was maintained around the solubility of NTD-CSA, indicating better stability at appropriate drug loads.
Source Paragraph: The dissolution and stability of NTD-CSA in SNEDDS vehicle (Cap-ryol 90: Cremophr EL: Transcutol P = 4:3:3, w/w/w) was examined (Fig. 5 (A)). In the case of loading dose 34.80 (± 2.69) mg as NTD/g SNEDDS, the dissolved concentration of NTD decreased and reached around 20 mg/g SNEDDS. On the other hand, the loaded NTD was almost completely dissolved until the end of study in the case of 18 mg (17.96 ± 0.64) as NTD/g SNEDDS. As for SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50 (loading dose, 20.15 ± 0.59 mg as NTD/g SNEDDS), although the final concentration was slightly lower than the initial value (17.16 ± 0.92 mg/g SNEDDS, not significant compared with the initial value), the concentration was maintained around the solubility of NTD in SNEDDS vehicle for NTD-CSA (Table 3). On the other hand, around 2 mg NTD/g SNEDDS was maintained for NTD-ESA (2.34 ± 0.18 mg as NTD/g SNEDDS) after dissolved by sonication. Fig. 5 (B) indicated fractions of NTD or CSA dissolved in SNEDDS vehicle for 28 days for NTD-CSA. The values for NTD and CSA were very similar throughout the experiment, indicating that both molecules should be dissolved together in SNEDDS vehicle. A slight discrepancy was observed between NTD and CSA in the case of 2% HPMCP-50 SNEDDS, but this could be due to the over-estimation of the values of fraction dissolved for CSA.

Q: 13. How did the dissolution profile of NTD-CSA powder compare to NTD-CSA SNEDDS and Ofev® under small intestinal luminal conditions, and what was the reason for any observed limitations?
A & Reasoning: Under small intestinal conditions (pH6.5 FaSSIF), NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulations showed almost complete dissolution, whereas NTD-CSA powder and Ofev® exhibited very low dissolution. Although NTD-CSA powder initially improved dissolution transiently (10 times larger than NTD-ESA/Ofev®), rapid precipitation occurred due to a high degree of supersaturation (around 2 times larger than NTD-ESA), which promoted nucleation and 'surface precipitation'. This suggests that while CSA dissolved, NTD itself precipitated based on its inherent low solubility.
Source Paragraph: Under the small intestinal luminal condition, only NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulations indicated almost complete dissolution of NTD from the beginning to the end of the experiment, while other preparations including NTD-CSA powder and Ofev® provided very low dissolution of NTD (Fig. 7 (A)). The inset of Fig. 7 (A) for NTD-CSA powder, NTD-ESA, and Ofev®, indicated that NTD-CSA powder improved the dissolution of NTD transiently around 10 times larger compared with NTD-ESA pow-der or Ofev®. However, the precipitation was promoted very rapidly because the degree of supersaturation was around 2 times larger for NTD-CSA (12.0; 0.53 mg/mL(=12% in Fig. 7(A))/0.044 mg/mL (Table 3)) than NTD-ESA (5.3; 0.063 mg/mL(=1.3%, Fig. 7(A))/0.012 mg/mL (Table 2)). It is well known that the nucleation rate is highly dependent on the degree of supersaturation (Brouwers et al., 2009). Furthermore, a "surface precipitation", very prevalent for soluble salts of poorly water-soluble chemicals (Hawley and Morozowich, 2010), might also have facilitated the precipitation of NTD for NTD-CSA. Fig. 7 (B) revealed that CSA was also almost completely dissolved throughout the study for both SNEDDS preparations. In addition, CSA was dissolved very rapidly to very large extent for NTD-CSA powder as well. Consid-ering these results, it is suggested that NTD-CSA released from nano-emulsion droplets and/or micelles would be dissociated and then CSA would be dissolved, but NTD would precipitate based on its own solu-bility. Therefore, most of NTD would be dissolved in nanoemulsion

Q: 14. How did HPMCP-50 influence the release of NTD from nanoemulsion droplets in pH3.9 and pH6.5 buffers, and what is the physicochemical explanation for this difference?
A & Reasoning: HPMCP-50 significantly suppressed the release of NTD from nanoemulsion droplets in both pH3.9 and pH6.5 buffers, with a stronger effect observed in pH3.9 buffer (ratio 0.64) compared to pH6.5 FaSSIF (ratio 0.83). This difference is due to HPMCP-50's pH-dependent solubility: it is insoluble under acidic conditions (pH3.9), causing it to remain incorporated within the nanoemulsion droplets and increase their viscosity, thus suppressing NTD release. In contrast, HPMCP-50 is soluble in neutral/basic conditions (pH6.5 FaSSIF), leading to its release from the droplets and a relatively lower viscosity, resulting in less suppression of NTD release.
Source Paragraph: Then, the concentrations of NTD dissolved directly in pH3.9 buffer and pH6.5 FaSSIF were determined after separated from nanoemulsion droplets and/or micelles by ultrafiltration (Fig. 8). As for NTD-CSA SNEDDS without HPMCP-50, NTD concentrations dissolved directly in the aqueous phase were around 3.4 times higher in pH3.9 buffer than those in pH6.5 FaSSIF, where mean values throughout the experiments were 667.2 ± 133.4 µg/mL in pH3.9 acetate buffer and 196.8 ± 33.5 µg/mL in pH6.5 FaSSIF (vs. pH3.9, p < 0.001). In the case of NTD-CSA SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50, NTD concentrations in pH3.9 buffer and pH6.5 FaSSIF were 429.7 ± 42.4 µg/mL and 162.6 ± 29.1 µg/mL (vs. pH3.9, p < 0.001), respectively. The results also clearly indicated that HPMCP-50 significantly suppressed the release of NTD from the nano-emulsion droplets and/or micelles in both buffers and that the sup-pressing effect was stronger in pH3.9 buffer (with/without HPMCP-50 ratio in NTD concentration, 0.64) than in pH6.5 FaSSIF (with/without HPMCP-50 ratio in NTD concentration, 0.83). The reasons for these phenomena could be as follows. NTD was dissolved at higher concen-trations in pH3.9 acetate buffer due to its higher solubility than in pH6.5 FaSSIF. On the other hand, HPMCP-50 is insoluble under acidic condi-tions, but soluble in neutral and basic aqueous vehicles (Home page of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.). Therefore, HPMCP-50 should be incor-porated in the nanoemulsion droplets without being released in pH3.9 buffer, leading to the higher viscosity within the droplets. In contrast, HPMCP-50 would have been released from the nanoemulsion droplets due to its solubility in pH6.5 FaSSIF (Home page of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), leading to relatively lower viscosity within the droplets.

Q: 15. What unexpected observation was made regarding particle sizes in the NTD-CSA SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50, and what is the proposed explanation?
A & Reasoning: The inclusion of both NTD-CSA and 2% HPMCP-50 unexpectedly resulted in very large particle sizes and high polydispersity index (pdi) values in all aqueous vehicles. The proposed explanation is that these larger particles were aggregates formed by HPMCP-50 itself, possibly because NTD-CSA decreased HPMCP-50's solubility in the SNEDDS vehicle, causing HPMCP-50 to be pushed out from nanoemulsion droplets and aggregate. This suggests a need for formulation improvement regarding HPMCP-50 content and SNEDDS vehicle components.
Source Paragraph: Since we observed that pH3.9 buffer and pH6.5 FaSSIF became cloudy during the dissolution studies above, the particle sizes of nano-emulsion droplets diluted with distilled water, pH3.9 buffer, or pH6.5 FaSSIF were determined for NTD-CSA SNEDDS with or without 2% HPMCP-50 and compared with those for SNEDDS vehicle and 2% HPMCP-50 SNEDDS without NTD-CSA (Table 4). NTD-CSA increased the droplet sizes only in distilled water, but to a lesser extent. HPMCP-50 increased those in distilled water and pH3.9 acetate buffer, revealing that HPMCP-50 tended to increase droplet sizes more than NTD-CSA except in FaSSIF. Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of both NTD-CSA and 2% HPMCP-50 unexpectedly resulted in very large sizes and pdi values in all the aqueous vehicles (Table 4). However, Figs. 6 and 7 indicated that NTD-CSA was almost completely dissolved in the filtrate through 0.45 µm filter and the concentrations of NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase of buffers were very low (Fig. 8), indi-cating that almost all of NTD-CSA should be incorporated into the nanoemulsion droplets and/or micelles less than 450 nm in diameter. Then, we confirmed that nanoemulsion droplets in the supernatant ob-tained after centrifuging the samples prepared for determining the particle size were smaller than those before centrifugation, also less than 450 nm (Table 4). Furthermore, 106.3 ± 5.3% (n = 3), 95.8 ± 1.7% (n = 3), and 87.7 ± 4.1% (n = 3) of NTD were recovered in the obtained supernatant for distilled water, acetate buffer, and pH6.5 FaSSIF, respectively. Although the recovery in pH6.5 FaSSIF was lower than others, NTD would have been precipitated following its release from nanoemulsion droplets, which might have been induced due to the release of HPMCP-50, soluble in pH6.5 FaSSIF, during the centrifuga-tion. Therefore, we think that larger particles detected would be ag-gregates formed by HPMCP-50 itself, which were also observed in our previous study (Sumimoto et al., 2022). The details remain to be clari-fied, but NTD-CSA might have decreased the solubility of HPMCP-50 in SNEDDS vehicle and HPMCP-50 pushed out from the nanoemulsion droplets would have aggregated. This possibility suggests that formu-lation improvement should be needed in terms of HPMCP-50 contents and the components of SNEDDS vehicle.

Q: 16. What was the key finding from the in vivo oral absorption study regarding the 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulation compared to Ofev®?
A & Reasoning: The 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulation provided significantly higher plasma concentrations and a larger AUC (1.52 times greater) compared to Ofev®. It also reduced the inter-individual variation in oral absorption kinetics, indicating its superior performance for improving NTD absorption.
Source Paragraph: prepared for NTD including Ofev® (Fig. 9 and Table 5). Two% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS provided significantly higher plasma concentra-tions and larger AUC compared with other preparations including OfevⓇ and NTD-CSA SNEDDS without HPMCP-50. Specifically, the AUC of NTD obtained by 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS was significantly 1.52 times larger than that of Ofev®. Considering that the outcome of amorphous solid dispersion (Qin et al., 2022) or lipid carrier preparation (Zhu et al., 2020) would be equivalent or inferior to Ofev®, respectively, based on the reported values of AUC, 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS would be more promising for improving NTD absorption. Furthermore, Fig. 9 (B) revealed that 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS could reduce the inter-individual variation in oral absorption kinetics compared with Ofev®, which has been reported to cause a relatively large inter-individual variability (Wind et al., 2019). These results clearly indi-cated that the combination of co-amorphization with SNEDDS has been successful for the improvement of oral absorption behavior of NTD. On the other hand, NTD-CSA SNEDDS without HPMCP-50 preparation was almost equivalent to Ofev®, indicating the importance of HPMCP-50.

Q: 17. Was lymphatic transport a significant contributor to the improved absorption of NTD by the 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS, and why?
A & Reasoning: No, lymphatic transport was not expected to be a significant contributor to the improved absorption. This is because the solubility of NTD-CSA in olive oil (21 µg/mL) and its clogP value (3.6) do not meet the prerequisites for preferential lymphatic transport, which typically requires solubility over 50 mg/mL in triglyceride of long-chain fatty acid and a logP value over 5.
Source Paragraph: Contribution of lymphatic transport to the absorption improvement of NTD by 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS would not be so large since the solubility of NTD-CSA is only 21 µg/mL in olive oil and clogP is deduced to be similar to that of NTD-ESA (3.6, Table 1) (Sumimoto et al., 2022), which do not meet the pre-requisites for preferential lymphatic transport (over 50 mg/mL of solubility in triglyceride of long-chain fatty acid and over 5 of logP value) (Charman et al., 1986), and long-chain fatty acids facilitating lymphatic drug transport (Porter et al., 2008; Imada et al., 2015) were not used to prepare SNEDDS formulations in the current study.

Q: 18. What is a proposed reason for the higher-than-expected oral absorption of NTD-CSA and NTD-NSA powders?
A & Reasoning: The higher-than-expected oral absorption of NTD-CSA and NTD-NSA powders is attributed to 'spontaneous supersaturation' formed after transfer to the small intestine from the very good dissolution of NTD in pH3.9 acetate buffer. This phenomenon is known to largely contribute to absorption from the proximal regions of the small intestine, as observed with other drugs like atazanavir and itraconazole.
Source Paragraph: Then, we have attempted to discuss the issue as follows: (i) Reasons for oral absorption higher than expected for NTD-CSA, NTD-NSA powders; Very good dissolution of NTD in pH3.9 acetate buffer (Fig. 6 (A)) suggests that the "spontaneous supersaturation" (Brouwers et al., 2009) would have been formed after transferred to the small intestine, which would largely contribute to the absorption from the proximal regions of small intestine. In fact, it was reported that the oral absorption of atazanavir (Tomilo et al., 2006) or itraconazole (Lim et al., 1993; Willems et al., 2001) was dependent on the degree of spontaneous supersaturation.

Q: 19. What are the potential reasons for the discrepancy between in vitro dissolution results and in vivo oral absorption for SNEDDS formulations?
A & Reasoning: The discrepancy may arise because the in vitro dissolution studies, conducted under constant pH conditions, do not fully replicate the sequential exposure from gastric to small intestinal environments in vivo. Potential in vivo phenomena include: i) changes in physicochemical properties of nanoemulsion droplets or lipoidal components, ii) subsequent changes in drug release properties from nanoemulsion droplets, iii) NTD precipitating instead of being absorbed after transfer to the small intestine, and iv) facilitated nucleation of NTD from newly released nanoemulsion droplets or micelles.
Source Paragraph: b) Taking into account of considerations above, the maintenance of supersaturation as observed in the in vitro dissolution study (Fig. 7 (A)) might not have occurred in vivo after oral dosing. In the current study, we performed the in vitro dissolution studies at constant acidic (pH3.9) or neutral condition (pH6.5), but some phenomena might have occurred only through a sequential exposure from the gastric to the small intes-tinal environments in vivo, i.e., i) possible changes in physicochemical properties of nanoemulsion droplets and/or lipoidal component forming nanoemulsion droplets, ii) subsequent changes in release properties of drugs from nanoemulsion droplets. iii) NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase at higher concentrations under acidic condition than those under neutral condition (Fig. 8) might have precipitated instead of being absorbed after transferred to the small intestine. iv) This precip-itation might have also facilitated the nucleation of NTD newly released from nanoemulsion droplets and/or micelles.

Q: 20. What is the main conclusion of this study regarding the improved formulation of nintedanib, and what future work is suggested?
A & Reasoning: The main conclusion is that co-amorphization of NTD-ESA with CSA successfully disrupted its high crystallinity, forming NTD-CSA. The SNEDDS formulation of NTD-CSA with 2% HPMCP-50 greatly enhanced NTD dissolution under small intestinal conditions and significantly outperformed Ofev® in vivo oral absorption. Future work should focus on clarifying the reasons for the large discrepancy observed between in vitro and in vivo performances to further improve NTD absorption.
Source Paragraph: By using CSA as a counter ion, the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA was disrupted and NTD was successfully co-amorphized with CSA to form NTD-CSA. Furthermore, the SNEDDS formulation of NTD-CSA with 2% HPMCP-50 greatly enhanced NTD dissolution under the small intestinal luminal conditions, and significantly outperformed Ofev® in the in vivo oral absorption of NTD. For further improvement of NTD absorption, the reasons for the large discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo perfor-mances should be clarified.
