=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS ===

SUMMARY:
Nintedanib (NTD) is a 'brick dust' drug characterized by high crystallinity, a high melting point (305°C), and poor solubility in both aqueous and lipoidal vehicles, leading to low oral bioavailability (4.7%). This study aimed to improve NTD absorption by forming a co-amorphous complex with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and incorporating it into a Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery System (SNEDDS). The NTD-CSA complex successfully disrupted the high crystallinity of NTD-ethanesulfonate (NTD-ESA), resulting in an amorphous state as confirmed by DSC and XRPD. The solubility of NTD-CSA in the SNEDDS vehicle (Capryol 90, Cremophor EL, and Transcutol P) was 15 times higher than that of NTD-ESA. Furthermore, the addition of 2% HPMCP-50 as a precipitation inhibitor maintained supersaturation. In vivo rat studies demonstrated that the 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulation significantly increased the AUC by 1.52-fold compared to the commercial product Ofev® and reduced inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability.

QUESTION & ANSWER PAIRS
==================================================

Pair #1
Q: 1. What physicochemical characteristics classify Nintedanib ethanesulfonate (NTD-ESA) as a 'brick dust' compound?
A & Reasoning: NTD-ESA is classified as 'brick dust' because it is highly crystalline, possesses a high melting point of 305°C, and exhibits very low solubility in neutral/basic aqueous vehicles and lipoidal vehicles. Reasoning: Compounds with high crystal packing energy and high melting points (typically >200°C) often show poor solubility due to the high energy required to break the crystal lattice, a hallmark of 'brick dust' molecules.
Source Paragraph: NTD-ESA is highly crystalline with 305◦C of melting point (Roth et al., 2015 and Table 1) and its solubility in aqueous vehicle under neutral or basic pH and several lipoidal vehicles is quite low (Wind et al., 2019 and Table 2), indicating that NTD-ESA should be one of compounds called as “brick dust”.

Q: 2. What are the primary biological and pharmaceutical reasons for the low oral bioavailability of the commercial Nintedanib product Ofev®?
A & Reasoning: The low bioavailability (approximately 4.7%) is attributed to efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), substantial first-pass metabolism in the small intestine and liver, and poor solubility (BCS class II or IV). Reasoning: P-gp actively pumps the drug back into the intestinal lumen, while metabolic enzymes degrade it before reaching systemic circulation; additionally, its 'brick dust' nature limits the amount of drug that can dissolve and be absorbed.
Source Paragraph: The bioavailability (BA) of NTD after oral dosing of Ofev® was around 4.7% (Dallinger et al., 2016), for which the reasons were suggested to be the efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Luedtke et al., 2018) and substantial first-pass metabolism via small intestine/liver (Summary of product characteristics, Ofev®, 2018).

Q: 3. What was the core methodology employed in this study to overcome the solubility limitations of Nintedanib?
A & Reasoning: The study utilized co-amorphization of NTD with a counter ion (specifically CSA) followed by incorporation into a Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery System (SNEDDS). Reasoning: Co-amorphization disrupts the stable crystal lattice of the 'brick dust' drug, while SNEDDS provides a lipid-based environment that facilitates the maintenance of the drug in a dissolved or nanoemulsified state, bypassing the slow dissolution step of crystalline solids.
Source Paragraph: In the current study, we aimed to improve the BA of NTD, a brick dust, by applying our strategy with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) or 2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA) as a counter ion, and successfully improved the solubility of NTD in various lipoidal vehicles by the co-amorphous formation with CSA, and improved the oral absorption of NTD by the SNEDDS formulation of the co-amorphous complex, NTD-CSA, compared with Ofev®, a marketed medicine of NTD-ESA.

Pair #4
Q: 4. Why was 2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA) considered less effective than CSA as a counter ion for NTD complexation?
A & Reasoning: NSA only improved NTD solubility up to a certain point (20 μmol/mL) before it decreased, suggesting limited interaction and an inability to efficiently replace the ethanesulfonate (ESA) ion. Reasoning: The decrease in solubility after reaching a 1:1 molar ratio indicates that the NTD-NSA complex might have its own solubility limits or that the displacement of the original ESA ion was incomplete or unstable compared to the CSA interaction.
Source Paragraph: As shown in Fig. 2 (A), NSA increased the solubility of NTD until around 20 μmol/mL where NTD-NSA was formed at 1 : 1 molar ratio, but thereafter the solubility fell down to ca 12 μmol/mL. Since the solubility of NTD-ESA is 2.41 μmol/mL, NSA improved the solubility of NTD, but the result indicated the interaction of NTD with NSA should be limited and NSA was not able to be replaced with ESA efficiently.

Q: 5. What evidence supported the successful formation of the NTD-CSA complex and the displacement of the original salt ion?
A & Reasoning: The evidence included a proportional increase in NTD solubility with increasing CSA concentration (molar ratio 100:107) and the absence of detectable ESA in the ethanol solution of the NTD-CSA powder. Reasoning: The linear increase in solubility suggests a strong, stoichiometric interaction, and the lack of ESA indicates that the camphorsulfonate ion successfully displaced the ethanesulfonate ion from the NTD molecule during complexation.
Source Paragraph: In contrast, Fig. 2 (B) clearly indicated that CSA increased the solubility of NTD proportionally as CSA amount increased and the complex was found to be formed at the molar ratio of NTD to CSA, 100 : 107. Furthermore, ESA was not detectable by HPLC in the ethanol solution dissolving NTD-CSA powder, suggesting that ESA would have been almost completely replaced with CSA in forming the complex with NTD.

Pair #6
Q: 6. How did the solid-state characterization of NTD-CSA differ from NTD-ESA, and what is the proposed mechanism for this change?
A & Reasoning: NTD-CSA showed a 'halo pattern' in both DSC and XRPD, indicating an amorphous state, whereas NTD-ESA was highly crystalline. The proposed mechanism is that the bulky, non-planar steric structure of CSA disrupted the crystal packing and symmetry of the NTD molecules. Reasoning: Amorphous states lack long-range order; the introduction of a structurally complex counter ion like CSA prevents the drug molecules from re-organizing into a stable, high-energy crystalline lattice.
Source Paragraph: In contrast, both DSC and XRPD charts revealed a hallo pattern for NTD-CSA (Fig. 3 (A) and (B)), clearly indicating that NTD-CSA should be amorphous. The reason why only CSA has disrupted the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA would be as follows. Since the planarity and/or symmetry is considered to be an issue to be overcome to enhance the solubility of brick dust-like drugs (Ishikawa and Hashimoto, 2011), the steric structure of CSA as shown in Fig. 1 (D) would efficiently have disrupted the crystal packing of NTD-ESA and would have been stably co-amorphized with NTD.

Q: 7. Quantify the solubility improvement of NTD-CSA over NTD-ESA in biorelevant intestinal media (pH 6.5 FaSSIF).
A & Reasoning: The solubility of NTD-CSA in pH 6.5 FaSSIF increased 3.7 times compared to NTD-ESA. Reasoning: Although the absolute solubility remains low (0.044 mg/mL for NTD-CSA vs 0.012 mg/mL for NTD-ESA), the nearly four-fold increase is significant for a brick dust drug, potentially increasing the concentration gradient for absorption in the small intestine.
Source Paragraph: NTD-CSA extensively improved the solubility of NTD in distilled water or pH3.9 acetate buffer. The solubility in pH6.5 FaSSIF, although still very low, also increased 3.7 times compared to that by NTD-ESA.

Pair #8
Q: 8. What is the specific composition and ratio of the SNEDDS vehicle used in the study?
A & Reasoning: The SNEDDS vehicle consisted of Capryol 90 (oil), Cremophor EL (surfactant), and Transcutol P (cosolvent) in a weight ratio of 4:3:3. Reasoning: This specific ratio was selected based on previous phase diagram studies showing a large area of nanoemulsion formation and proven performance in improving the solubility of other brick dust-like drugs.
Source Paragraph: The solubilities of NTD-ESA (Table 2) and NTD-CSA (Table 3) in each excipient indicated that Capryol 90 and Transcutol P should be selected as an oil component and a cosolvent of SNEDDS, respectively. Furthermore, since our previous results revealed that Capryol 90 : Cremophor EL : Transcutol P = 4 : 3 : 3 (w/w/w)... the composition was chosen to prepare the SNEDDS vehicle.

Pair #9
Q: 9. What role does HPMCP-50 play in the NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulation, and what was its measured effect in the solvent shift study?
A & Reasoning: HPMCP-50 acts as a precipitation inhibitor to maintain supersaturation. In the solvent shift study, it maintained NTD concentrations approximately five times higher than the control (no polymer) for 2 hours. Reasoning: Polymers like HPMCP-50 can kinetically stabilize supersaturated solutions by adsorbing onto drug nuclei or increasing viscosity, thereby delaying the nucleation and crystal growth of the drug when it is released into aqueous media.
Source Paragraph: As shown in Fig. 4, HPMCP-50 was able to maintain NTD concentrations around five times higher than those without HPMCP-50 for 2 h, suggesting its possible usage as a precipitation inhibitor.

Pair #10
Q: 10. What was the observed limitation regarding the drug loading stability of NTD-CSA in the SNEDDS vehicle?
A & Reasoning: The SNEDDS vehicle could not stably maintain a high loading dose of 34.80 mg/g, as the concentration dropped to 20 mg/g over time; however, it was stable at a lower loading dose of approximately 18 mg/g. Reasoning: This indicates that while co-amorphization increases solubility, there is still a thermodynamic limit to the amount of drug the lipid vehicle can hold in a stable dissolved state without eventual precipitation.
Source Paragraph: In the case of loading dose 34.80 (± 2.69) mg as NTD/g SNEDDS, the dissolved concentration of NTD decreased and reached around 20 mg/g SNEDDS. On the other hand, the loaded NTD was almost completely dissolved until the end of study in the case of 18 mg (17.96 ± 0.64) as NTD/g SNEDDS.

Pair #11
Q: 11. How did the dissolution of NTD-CSA SNEDDS compare to Ofev® under simulated small intestinal conditions (pH 6.5)?
A & Reasoning: NTD-CSA SNEDDS showed almost complete dissolution throughout the experiment, whereas Ofev® and NTD-CSA powder showed very low dissolution. Reasoning: In the neutral pH of the intestine, the solubility of NTD is extremely low. The SNEDDS formulation keeps the drug pre-solubilized in nano-droplets, preventing the precipitation that occurs when the drug powder or the oil suspension in Ofev® encounters the intestinal fluid.
Source Paragraph: Under the small intestinal luminal condition, only NTD-CSA SNEDDS formulations indicated almost complete dissolution of NTD from the beginning to the end of the experiment, while other preparations including NTD-CSA powder and Ofev® provided very low dissolution of NTD (Fig. 7 (A)).
PMID: Not Available
------------------------------
Pair #12
Q: 12. Why did the NTD-CSA powder fail to maintain high dissolution despite an initial 10-fold improvement over NTD-ESA?
A & Reasoning: The NTD-CSA powder created a higher degree of supersaturation (12.0 vs 5.3), which led to very rapid precipitation. Reasoning: According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation rate is highly dependent on the degree of supersaturation. The higher initial solubility of the amorphous NTD-CSA powder triggered faster crystal growth, quickly reverting the drug to its poorly soluble crystalline form.
Source Paragraph: The inset of Fig. 7 (A) for NTD-CSA powder, NTD-ESA, and Ofev®, indicated that NTD-CSA powder improved the dissolution of NTD transiently around 10 times larger compared with NTD-ESA powder or Ofev®. However, the precipitation was promoted very rapidly because the degree of supersaturation was around 2 times larger for NTD-CSA (12.0...) than NTD-ESA (5.3...).

Pair #13
Q: 13. How does the pH-dependent solubility of HPMCP-50 influence the release of NTD from the SNEDDS droplets?
A & Reasoning: HPMCP-50 is insoluble at acidic pH (gastric) but soluble at neutral/basic pH (intestinal). In the intestine, it dissolves and increases the viscosity within/around the nanoemulsion droplets, sustaining drug release. Reasoning: Because HPMCP-50 (pKa 4.32) only dissolves when the pH exceeds its pKa, its inhibitory effect on drug release and precipitation is specifically activated in the small intestinal environment, which is the primary site for absorption.
Source Paragraph: Furthermore, HPMCP-50, which can sustain the release of drugs dissolved in the nanoemulsion droplets by increasing the viscosity within the nanoemulsion droplets (Sumimoto et al., 2022), is substantially insoluble in the acidic aqueous vehicle, but soluble in neutral and basic aqueous vehicles (Home page of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.) since its pKa is 4.32 (Hiew et al., 2022).

Pair #14
Q: 14. Compare the concentration of NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase (ultrafiltrated) for the 2% HPMCP-50 SNEDDS between gastric and intestinal conditions.
A & Reasoning: In the 2% HPMCP-50 SNEDDS, the concentration of NTD dissolved directly in the aqueous phase was 429.7 μg/mL at pH 3.9 (gastric) and 162.6 μg/mL at pH 6.5 (intestinal). Reasoning: The higher concentration at pH 3.9 is due to the inherently higher solubility of the weakly basic NTD in acidic conditions; however, the presence of HPMCP-50 helps maintain a significant concentration even at the less favorable pH 6.5.
Source Paragraph: As for NTD-CSA SNEDDS without HPMCP-50, NTD concentrations dissolved directly in the aqueous phase were around 3.4 times higher in pH3.9 buffer than those in pH6.5 FaSSIF... In the case of NTD-CSA SNEDDS with 2% HPMCP-50, NTD concentrations in pH3.9 buffer and pH6.5 FaSSIF were 429.7 ± 42.4 μg/mL and 162.6 ± 29.1 μg/mL.

Q: 15. What was the primary pharmacokinetic improvement of the 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS over the commercial Ofev® formulation in rats?
A & Reasoning: The 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS achieved an AUC (Area Under the Curve) that was 1.52 times larger than that of Ofev®. Reasoning: This 52% increase in systemic exposure demonstrates that the combination of co-amorphization, lipid-based emulsification, and polymer-mediated precipitation inhibition successfully enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug.
Source Paragraph: Specifically, the AUC of NTD obtained by 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS was significantly 1.52 times larger than that of Ofev®.

------------------------------
Pair #16
Q: 16. Besides increasing bioavailability, what other significant pharmacokinetic advantage did the SNEDDS formulation provide?
A & Reasoning: The 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS reduced the inter-individual variation in oral absorption kinetics. Reasoning: Ofev® is an oil suspension with highly variable absorption (CV 46-83%). By providing the drug in a pre-solubilized nanoemulsion, the SNEDDS formulation makes the absorption process less dependent on individual physiological variations in gastric emptying and endogenous bile secretion.
Source Paragraph: Furthermore, Fig. 9 (B) revealed that 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS could reduce the inter-individual variation in oral absorption kinetics compared with Ofev®, which has been reported to cause a relatively large inter-individual variability (Wind et al., 2019).

------------------------------
Pair #17
Q: 17. Why is lymphatic transport considered an unlikely contributor to the improved absorption of the NTD SNEDDS formulation?
A & Reasoning: Lymphatic transport is unlikely because NTD-CSA does not meet the necessary criteria: its solubility in triglyceride (olive oil) is only 21 μg/mL (well below the required 50 mg/mL) and its clogP is 3.6 (below the required 5.0). Reasoning: For a drug to be significantly transported via the intestinal lymphatics, it must be highly lipophilic and highly soluble in the lipid core of chylomicrons, neither of which applies to NTD.
Source Paragraph: Contribution of lymphatic transport to the absorption improvement of NTD by 2% HPMCP-50 NTD-CSA SNEDDS would not be so large since the solubility of NTD-CSA is only 21 μg/mL in olive oil and clogP is deduced to be similar to that of NTD-ESA (3.6, Table 1)... which do not meet the pre-requisites for preferential lymphatic transport (over 50 mg/mL of solubility in triglyceride... and over 5 of logP value).

Pair #18
Q: 18. What was an unexpected negative physical outcome when combining NTD-CSA and 2% HPMCP-50 in the SNEDDS formulation?
A & Reasoning: The combination unexpectedly resulted in very large droplet sizes and high polydispersity index (PDI) values in aqueous vehicles. Reasoning: This suggests that the interaction between the amorphous drug complex and the polymer might lead to the formation of aggregates or unstable nanoemulsion droplets, which could potentially impact long-term physical stability or the rate of drug release.
Source Paragraph: Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of both NTD-CSA and 2% HPMCP-50 unexpectedly resulted in very large sizes and pdi values in all the aqueous vehicles (Table 4).
PMID: Not Available
------------------------------
Pair #19
Q: 19. Describe the laboratory-scale manufacturing process used to prepare the NTD-CSA complex powder.
A & Reasoning: The process involved dissolving NTD-ESA and CSA in distilled water at a specific molar ratio, vortex mixing, freezing the solution at -80°C for 6 hours, and then lyophilizing (freeze-drying) it for 12 hours. Reasoning: Lyophilization is a common method to produce amorphous solids from solution by rapidly removing the solvent, preventing the molecules from having enough time or mobility to form a crystalline lattice.
Source Paragraph: NTD-ESA and CSA were dissolved in distilled water at the molar ratio calculated based on the results obtained in Section 2.2 and vortex mixed. Then, the solution was frozen at − 80◦C for 6 h, and lyophilized for 12 h by a freeze dryer (FDU-2100, EYELA, Tokyo) to obtain NTD-CSA powder.

------------------------------
Pair #20
Q: 20. What is the final conclusion regarding the efficacy of the co-amorphization/SNEDDS strategy for Nintedanib?
A & Reasoning: The study concludes that the combination of co-amorphization with CSA and a polymer-containing SNEDDS formulation successfully overcomes the 'brick dust' properties of NTD, significantly improving intestinal dissolution and outperforming the commercial product Ofev® in oral absorption. Reasoning: The synergy between disrupting the crystal lattice (co-amorphization) and maintaining the drug in a nano-dispersed, supersaturated state (SNEDDS + HPMCP-50) is essential for improving the bioavailability of drugs with extreme solubility limitations.
Source Paragraph: By using CSA as a counter ion, the high crystallinity of NTD-ESA was disrupted and NTD was successfully co-amorphized with CSA to form NTD-CSA. Furthermore, the SNEDDS formulation of NTD-CSA with 2 % HPMCP-50 greatly enhanced NTD dissolution under the small intestinal luminal conditions, and significantly outperformed Ofev® in the in vivo oral absorption of NTD.
