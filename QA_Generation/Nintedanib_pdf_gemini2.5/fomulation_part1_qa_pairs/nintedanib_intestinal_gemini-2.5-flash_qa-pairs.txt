=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS ===

SUMMARY:
This study aimed to enhance the oral bioavailability of nintedanib (BIBF), a BCS II drug with poor absorption, by formulating it into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). Two types of NLCs, BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2, were prepared using the melt-emulsification technique. Both formulations exhibited nanoscale particle sizes and positive zeta potentials. In vitro studies on Caco-2 cells demonstrated superior cellular uptake and transmembrane transport for BIBF-NLCs-1. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed a significant improvement in oral bioavailability, with BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2 increasing it by 3.13-fold and 2.39-fold, respectively, compared to BIBF solution. Furthermore, both NLC formulations demonstrated excellent anti-tumor efficacy in LLC lung tumor-bearing mice and reduced the risk of gastrointestinal irritation and liver damage associated with BIBF. The findings suggest NLCs are a promising oral delivery system for improving BIBF's bioavailability through enhanced intestinal absorption and stability.

Q: 1. What was the primary conclusion regarding the use of Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) for nintedanib (BIBF) delivery?
A & Reasoning: NLCs are a potential oral delivery system to improve the bioavailability of BIBF by promoting intestinal absorption. This conclusion is drawn from the observed improvements in oral bioavailability (3.13-fold and 2.39-fold for BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2, respectively), excellent anti-tumor efficacy, and reduced gastrointestinal irritation and liver damage.
Source Paragraph: The aim of this study was to fabricate nanostructured lipid carriers, NLCs, of nintedanib (BIBF) to improve its oral bioavailability. Two types of NLCs loaded with BIBF (BIBF-NLCS-1 and BIBF-NLCS-2) were prepared by the melt-emulsification technique. BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCS-2 showed nanoscale particle sizes of 142.70 ± 0.85 nm and 7.99 ± 0.06 nm, and both were positive zeta potential. Study on Caco-2 cells showed that BIBF-NLCS-1 exhibited distinct advantages at the cytological level. The oral bioavailability of BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCS-2 was extremely improved 3.13-fold and 2.39-fold respectively compared with BIBF solution (BIBF-Sol). And in vivo anti-tumor efficiency study in mice bearing LLC lung tumor indicated that BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCS-2 had excellent tumor inhibition. Besides, the two NLCs did not increase the risk of liver damage and can even reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal irritation of BIBF to some extent. In summary, NLCs are a potential oral delivery system to improve the bioavailability of BIBF by promoting intestinal absorption.

Q: 2. What are the key physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of nintedanib (BIBF) that contribute to its poor oral bioavailability?
A & Reasoning: Nintedanib (BIBF) is classified as a BCS II drug, meaning it has low solubility and high permeability. It is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and undergoes a hepatic first-pass effect. These properties, particularly P-gp efflux during intestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass metabolism, collectively contribute to its poor oral bioavailability.
Source Paragraph: Nintedanib (BIBF 1120, abbreviated as BIBF) is a small molecule oral triple tyrosinase inhibitor, classified as a BCS II drug (Roth et al., 2015). It is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has a hepatic first-pass effect (Vaidya et al., 2019), which suggests a possible efflux of BIBF during intestinal absorption which further contributes to its poor bioavailability. BIBF can potently block three proangiogenic pathways, achieved by targeting three tyrosinase receptors (Reck, 2015), which have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Dimitroulis, 2014).

Q: 3. What is the reported oral bioavailability of a single-dose 100 mg BIBF soft capsule in healthy volunteers?
A & Reasoning: The reported oral bioavailability of a single-dose 100 mg BIBF soft capsule in healthy volunteers was approximately 4.69%. This value is considered very poor, highlighting the critical need for research to improve its oral bioavailability.
Source Paragraph: The current clinical application of BIBF is the soft capsule (Fukihara and Kondoh, 2016), Ofev®, which is developed, produced and marketed by the German Boehringer In-gelheim Company. According to their study, the bioavailability of a single-dose 100 mg BIBF soft capsule in healthy volunteers was approximately 4.69% (Vaidya et al., 2019), which is very poor. Hence, research to improve its oral bioavailability is critical.

Q: 4. Why was the solid dispersion (SD) strategy, which aimed to improve solubility, found to be ineffective in improving the oral bioavailability of BIBF?
A & Reasoning: The solid dispersion (SD) strategy, despite improving BIBF's solubility, did not increase its oral bioavailability because simply increasing the rate and extent of dissolution was insufficient. This indicates that other factors, such as intestinal absorption problems caused by P-gp efflux, are significant contributors to BIBF's poor bioavailability and must also be addressed.
Source Paragraph: Improving dissolution is a common and effective means to solve the poor oral bioavailability of BCS II drugs. However, as described in this study, the solid dispersion (SD) strategy was used in an attempt to improve the solubility of BIBF, however it did not increase oral bioavailability. This verified that simply increasing the rate and extent of dissolution could not effectively improve the bioavailability of BIBF, and thus other factors that lead to poor bioavailability of BIBF should be taken into account, such as intestinal absorption problems caused by P-gp efflux. Clinical reports have shown that the addition of P-gp in-hibitors can effectively improve the bioavailability of BIBF (Vaidya et al., 2019).

Q: 9. What were the specific solid lipid, liquid lipid, emulsifier, and co-surfactant used in the preparation of BIBF-NLCs-1?
A & Reasoning: For BIBF-NLCs-1, the solid lipid used was Glyceryl monooleate (1000 mg), the liquid lipid was Tricaprylin (500 mg), the emulsifier was Tween 80 (528 mg), and the co-surfactant was Poloxamer 407 (132 mg). These components were selected to form a stable nanostructured lipid matrix capable of encapsulating BIBF.
Source Paragraph: The first type of NLCs loaded with BIBF (BIBF-NLCS-1) was prepared by the melt-emulsification technique as previously reported (Yuan et al., 2007) with some changes. Briefly, 1000 mg solid lipid (Glyceryl monooleate), 500 mg liquid lipid (Tricaprylin) and 528 mg emulsifier (Tween 80) were melted at 70 °C in a water bath and stirred for 5 min at 3000 rpm until homogeneous. Then, 50 mg BIBF was added to the mixture and stirred for a further 30 min. Subsequently, the aqueous phase was prepared with 132 mg cosurfactant (Poloxamer 407) com-pletely dissolved in 8 mL ultrapure water, and then heated to the same temperature. The aqueous phase was slowly added dropwise into the hot lipid, and the mixture was emulsified at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The warm primary emulsion was further sonicated by a Lab ultrasonic cell pulverizer (SCIENTZ-IID, Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) for 13 min (work 2 s and stand 2.5 s) at 285 W to form the miniemulsion. Finally, BIBF-NLCs-1 was obtained by cooling the samples in an ice water bath to quickly crystallize the lipid.

Q: 15. How did the stability of BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2 compare in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF)?
A & Reasoning: Both BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2 maintained drug content above 94% after 6 hours in SGF, indicating good stability. In SIF, BIBF-NLCs-1 showed improved protection, while BIBF-NLCs-2's drug content decreased by nearly 10% after 6 hours, indicating weaker stability in intestinal fluid.
Source Paragraph: As shown in Fig. 3A, the drug content of BIBF-NLCs-1 and BIBF-NLCs-2 remained almost unchanged at 100% during incubation for 2 h in SGF. By extending the time to 6 h, the drug content of the two BIBF-NLCs still remained above 94%. However, the drug content of BIBF-NLCs-2 incubated for 6 h in SIF decreased by nearly 10%, with an onset around the second hour. When considering drug content, BIBF-NLCs-1 showed improved protection for the drugs in the intestinal environ-ment. From the change in particle size (Fig. 3B and C), only BIBF-NLCS-2 showed significant changes during SGF incubation, the particle size increased from 7.88 ± 0.26 nm to 191.00 ± 13.02 nm after 2 h and then decreased to 17.14 ± 3.02 nm after 6 h, which indicated that the acid resistance of BIBF-NLCS-2 was relatively weak. The decline in drug content and the appearance of aggregation may be related to its large relative surface area and low surface potential.

Pair #19
Q: 19. Besides dissolution, what other factors contribute to the poor oral bioavailability of BIBF, and what alternative strategy was mentioned to address one of these factors?
A & Reasoning: Besides dissolution, intestinal absorption problems caused by P-gp efflux significantly contribute to the poor oral bioavailability of BIBF. An alternative strategy mentioned is the addition of P-gp inhibitors, which clinical reports have shown can effectively improve BIBF's bioavailability by reducing drug efflux.
Source Paragraph: Improving dissolution is a common and effective means to solve the poor oral bioavailability of BCS II drugs. However, as described in this study, the solid dispersion (SD) strategy was used in an attempt to improve the solubility of BIBF, however it did not increase oral bioavailability. This verified that simply increasing the rate and extent of dissolution could not effectively improve the bioavailability of BIBF, and thus other factors that lead to poor bioavailability of BIBF should be taken into account, such as intestinal absorption problems caused by P-gp efflux. Clinical reports have shown that the addition of P-gp in-hibitors can effectively improve the bioavailability of BIBF (Vaidya et al., 2019).

Q: 20. What are the primary mechanisms by which nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) improved the oral bioavailability of BIBF?
A & Reasoning: NLCs improved the oral bioavailability of BIBF primarily by reducing P-gp efflux and enhancing intestinal absorption. This is achieved by encapsulating BIBF within the lipid carriers, which helps to bypass P-gp mediated efflux and promotes uptake by intestinal cells.
Source Paragraph: In summary, the oral bioavailability of BIBF is successfully in-creased using a nanostructured lipid carrier as the delivery vector, achieved by reducing P-gp efflux and improving intestinal absorption. The two BIBF-NLCs may reduce the intestinal irritation of BIBF and not cause an increase in liver toxicity. Besides, in vivo anti-tumor efficiency study in mice bearing LLC lung tumor indicated that BIBF-NLCS-1 and BIBF-NLCS-2 had excellent tumor inhibition. The results of this study were encouraging for further development of nanotechnology ap-proaches in the field of oral small molecule targeted drugs.
