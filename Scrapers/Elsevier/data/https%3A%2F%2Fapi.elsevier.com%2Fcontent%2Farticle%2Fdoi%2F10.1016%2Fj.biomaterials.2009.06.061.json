Free-standing nanoparticles with diameters of 100\u2013300nm were successfully fabricated from highly hydrophobic, biodegradable poly(\u03c9-pentadecalactone-co-butylene-co-succinate) (PPBS) copolyesters. PPBS copolymers with various compositions (20\u201380mol% PDL unit contents) were synthesized via copolymerization of \u03c9-pentadecalactone (PDL), diethyl succinate (DES), and 1,4-butanediol (BD) using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as the catalyst. Camptothecin (CPT, 12\u201322%) was loaded into PPBS nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency (up to 96%) using a modified oil-in-water single emulsion technique. The CPT-loaded nanoparticles had a zeta potential of about \u221210mV. PPBS particles were non-toxic in cell culture. Upon encapsulation, the active lactone form of CPT was remarkably stabilized and no lactone-to-carboxylate structural conversion was observed for CPT-loaded PPBS nanoparticles incubated in both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH=7.4) and DMEM medium for at least 24h. In PBS at 37\u00b0C, CPT-loaded PPBS nanoparticles showed a low burst CPT release (20\u201330%) within the first 24h followed by a sustained, essentially complete, release of the remaining drug over the subsequent 40 days. Compared to free CPT, CPT-loaded PPBS nanoparticles showed a significant enhancement of cellular uptake, higher cytotoxicity against Lewis lung carcinoma and 9L cell lines in vitro, a longer circulation time, and substantially better antitumor efficacy in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential of PPBS nanoparticles as long-term stable and effective drug delivery systems in cancer therapy.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Camptothecin"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polymer nanoparticle"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hydrophobic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Controlled release"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Antitumor effect"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961209006863", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961209006863", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "68549136478", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-68549136478", "pubmed-id": "19632718", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68549136478", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090725", "$": "2009-07-25"}}}}}
