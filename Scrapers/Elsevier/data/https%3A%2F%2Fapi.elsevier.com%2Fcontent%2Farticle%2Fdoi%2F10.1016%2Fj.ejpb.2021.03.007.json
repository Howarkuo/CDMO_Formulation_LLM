Compared to liquid pharmaceutical products, dry powder has the potential to reduce costs associated with refrigerated storage and transportation. In this study, spray drying was investigated for processing an adjuvanted tuberculosis subunit vaccine, formulated as an oil-in-water nanoemulsion, into a dry powder composed of microparticles. Applying in-silico approaches to the development of formulation and processing conditions, successful encapsulation of the adjuvanted vaccine within amorphous microparticles was achieved in only one iteration, with high retention (>90%) of both the antigen and adjuvant system. Moisture-controlled stability studies on the powder were conducted over 26\u00a0months at temperatures up to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Results showed that the powder was physically stable after 26\u00a0months of storage for all tested temperatures. Adjuvant system integrity was maintained at temperatures up to 25\u00a0\u00b0C after 26\u00a0months and after one month of storage at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The spray-dried product demonstrated improved antigen thermostability when stored above refrigerated temperatures as compared to the liquid product. These results demonstrate the feasibility of spray drying as a method of encapsulating and stabilizing an adjuvanted vaccine.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nano-encapsulation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Physical stability"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gel microparticles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Vaccine spray drying"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adjuvant emulsion"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939641121000710", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939641121000710", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85105019920", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85105019920", "pubmed-id": "33753213", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105019920", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20210319", "$": "2021-03-19"}}}}}
