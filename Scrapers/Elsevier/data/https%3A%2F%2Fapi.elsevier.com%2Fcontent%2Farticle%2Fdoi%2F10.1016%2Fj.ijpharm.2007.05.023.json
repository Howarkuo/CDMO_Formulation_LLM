Cationic nanoparticles were prepared using different molecular weights of poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(dl-lactic acid) (PLA) by double emulsion solvent evaporation at two different homogenization speeds, and were characterized in terms of size, surface charge, morphology, loading efficiency, plasmid release, plasmid integrity, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency. Cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was used to provide positive charge on the surface of nanoparticles. Reporter plasmid gWIZ\u2122 Beta-gal was loaded on the surface of nanoparticles by incubation. Use of higher homogenization speed and lower molecular weight polymer led to a decrease in mean particle size, increase in zeta potential, increase in plasmid loading efficiency, and a decrease in burst release. The nanoparticles displayed good morphology as evident from scanning electron micrographs. In vitro cytotoxicity study by MTT assay showed a low toxicity. Structural integrity of the pDNA released from nanoparticles was maintained. Transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells with nanoparticles prepared from low molecular weight PLGA and PLA resulted in an increased expression of beta-galactosidase as compared to those prepared from high molecular weight polymer. Our results demonstrate that the PLGA and PLA cationic nanoparticles can be used to achieve prolonged release of pDNA, and the plasmid release rate and transfection efficiency are dependent on the formulation variables.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Poly(dl-lactic acid) (PLA)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cationic nanoparticles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Plasmid DNA (pDNA)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cytotoxicity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Transfection efficiency"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037851730700453X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037851730700453X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "34548324409", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-34548324409", "pubmed-id": "17611054", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548324409", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070518", "$": "2007-05-18"}}}}}
