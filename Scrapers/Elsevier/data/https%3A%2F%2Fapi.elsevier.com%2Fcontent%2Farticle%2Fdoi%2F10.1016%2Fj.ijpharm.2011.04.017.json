The particles were prepared by a double-emulsion solvent evaporation method with PEI-25kDa in the internal aqueous phase to produce an osmotic pressure gradient. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used for external coating of the particles. The particles were examined for morphology, size, aerodynamic diameter, surface area, pore volume and in-vitro release profiles. Particles with optimal properties for inhalation were tested for in-vivo pulmonary absorption, metabolic stability in rat lung homogenates, and acute toxicity in rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory epithelial cells, Calu-3. The micromeritic data indicated that the PEI-modified particles of PGE1 are optimal for inhalation. Incorporation of PEI in the formulations resulted in an increased entrapment efficiency \u2013 83.26\u00b13.04% for particles with 1% PVA and 95.48\u00b10.46% for particles with 2% PVA. The amount of cumulative drug released into the simulated interstitial lung fluid was between 50.8\u00b10.76% and 55.36\u00b10.06%. A remarkable extension of the circulation half-life up to 6.0\u20136.5h was observed when the formulations were administered via the lungs. The metabolic stability and toxicity studies showed that the optimized formulations were stable at physiological conditions and relatively safe to the lungs and respiratory epithelium. Overall, this study demonstrates that large porous inhalable polymeric microparticles can be a feasible option for non-invasive and controlled release of PGE1 for treatment of PAH.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prostaglandin E1\n                  "}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PLGA microparticles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Core modifying polyethyleneimine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pulmonary delivery"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517311003218", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517311003218", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79958002525", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79958002525", "pubmed-id": "21530623", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79958002525", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110416", "$": "2011-04-16"}}}}}
