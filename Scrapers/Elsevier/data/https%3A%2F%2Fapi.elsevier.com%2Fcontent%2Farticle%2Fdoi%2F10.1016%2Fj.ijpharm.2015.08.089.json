High burst release can be associated with adverse effects and the efficacy of the formulation cannot be ensured during a long lag phase. Accordingly, the development of a long-acting microsphere product requires optimization of all drug release phases. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether a blend of low and high molecular weight polymers can be used to reduce the burst release and eliminate/minimize the lag phase. A single emulsion solvent evaporation method was used to prepare microspheres using blends of two PLGA polymers (PLGA5050 (25kDa) and PLGA9010 (113kDa)). A central composite design approach was applied to investigate the effect of formulation composition on dexamethasone release from these microspheres. Mathematical models obtained from this design of experiments study were utilized to generate a design space with maximized microsphere drug loading and reduced burst release. Specifically, a drug loading close to 15% can be achieved and a burst release less than 10% when a composition of 80% PLGA9010 and 90mg of dexamethasone is used. In order to better describe the lag phase, a heat map was generated based on dexamethasone release from the PLGA microsphere/PVA hydrogel composite coatings. Using the heat map an optimized formulation with minimum lag phase was selected. The microspheres were also characterized for particle size/size distribution, thermal properties and morphology. The particle size was demonstrated to be related to the polymer concentration and the ratio of the two polymers but not to the dexamethasone concentration.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Design of experiment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mathematical model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PLGA"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polymer blends"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Release profile"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Microspheres"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517315301873", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517315301873", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84941885348", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84941885348", "pubmed-id": "26325309", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941885348", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20150829", "$": "2015-08-29"}}}}}
