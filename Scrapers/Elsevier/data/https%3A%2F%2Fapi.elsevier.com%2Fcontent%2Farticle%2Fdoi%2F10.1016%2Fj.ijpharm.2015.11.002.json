We investigated influence of polymer composition on acylation of octreotide and kinetics of release during in vitro release from biodegradable polymeric formulations. Polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) based triblock (TB\u2248PCL10k-PEG2k-PCL10k) and pentablock (PBA\u2248PLA3k-PCL7k-PEG2k-PCL7k-PLA3k and PBB\u2248PGA3k-PCL7k-PEG2k-PCL7k-PGA3k) polymers were investigated. Octreotide was encapsulated in MPs using methanol\u2013oil/water emulsion solvent evaporation method. The particles were characterized for size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading and in vitro release. Release samples were subjected to HPLC analysis for quantitation and HPLC-MS analysis for identification of native and chemically modified octreotide adducts. Entrapment efficiency of methanol-oil/water method with TB, PBA and PBB polymers were 45%, 60%, and 82%, respectively. A significant fraction of released octreotide was acylated from lactide and glycolide based PBA (53%) and PBB (92%) polymers. Substantial amount of peptide was not released from PBB polymers after 330 days of incubation. Complete release of octreotide was achieved from TB polymer over a period of 3 months with minimal acylation of peptide (13%). PCL based polymers resulted in minimal acylation of peptide and hence may be suitable for extended peptide and protein delivery. Conversely, polymers having PLA and PGA blocks may not be appropriate for peptide delivery due to acylation and incomplete release.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polycaprolactone"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polyglycolic acid"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polylactic acid"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hydrogel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Peptide"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Microparticles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Drug delivery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sustained delivery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Peptide chemical stability"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517315303525", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517315303525", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84949580211", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84949580211", "pubmed-id": "26561725", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949580211", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20151110", "$": "2015-11-10"}}}}}
