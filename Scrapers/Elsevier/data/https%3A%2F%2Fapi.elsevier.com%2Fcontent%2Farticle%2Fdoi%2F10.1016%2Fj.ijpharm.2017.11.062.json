Unlike tocopherols, however, the tocotrienol (T3) isomers of vitamin E were found to have innate anticancer activity and were shown to potentiate the antitumor activity of paclitaxel. The primary objective of the present study was therefore to develop a paclitaxel nanoemulsions by substituting \u03b1-T oil core of Tocosol\u2122 with \u03b3-T3 in, and vitamin E TPGS with PEGylated \u03b3-T3 as the shell, and test the nanoemulsions against Bx-PC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic tumor cells. A secondary objective was to test the activity of paclitaxel when directly conjugated with the \u03b3-T3 isomer of vitamin E. The synthesis of the conjugates was confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Developed nanoemulsions were loaded with free or lipid conjugated paclitaxel. Nanoemulsions droplets were <300\u2009nm with fastest release observed with formulations loaded with free paclitaxel when \u03b3-T3 was used as the core. Substituting \u03b1-T with \u03b3-T3 was also found to potentiate the anticancer activity of the nanoemulsions. Although marginal increase in activity was observed when nanoemulsions were loaded with free paclitaxel, a significant increase in activity was observed when lipid conjugates were used. The results from this study suggest that the developed paclitaxel nanoemulsions with either \u03b3-T3, PEGylated \u03b3-T3, or paclitaxel lipid conjugates may represent a more promising option for paclitaxel delivery in cancer chemotherapy.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nanoemulsion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Paclitaxel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tocotrienol"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PEGylation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Vitamin E TPGS"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Drug delivery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cancer chemotherapy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nanotechnology"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517317311171", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517317311171", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85035759089", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85035759089", "pubmed-id": "29195915", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035759089", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20171202", "$": "2017-12-02"}}}}}
