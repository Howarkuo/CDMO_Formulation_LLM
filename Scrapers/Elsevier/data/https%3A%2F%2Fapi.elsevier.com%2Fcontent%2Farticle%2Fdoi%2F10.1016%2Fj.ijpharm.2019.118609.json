Herein, we report a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulation of DHA-dFdC with improved apparent aqueous solubility, chemical stability, as well as efficacy in a mouse model. The SLNs were prepared from lecithin/glycerol monostearate-in-water emulsions emulsified with D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Tween 20. The resultant DHA-dFdC-SLNs were 102.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.3\u202fnm in diameter and increased the apparent solubility of DHA-dFdC in water to at least 5.2\u202fmg/mL, more than 200-fold higher than its intrinsic water solubility. DHA-dFdC in a lyophilized powder of DHA-dFdC-SLNs was significantly more stable than the waxy solid of pure DHA-dFdC. DHA-dFdC-SLNs also showed an increased cytotoxicity against certain tumor cells than DHA-dFdC. The plasma concentration of DHA-dFdC in mice intravenously injected with DHA-dFdC-SLNs in dispersion followed a bi-exponential model, with a half-life of ~44\u202fh. In mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma, DHA-dFdC-SLNs were significantly more effective than DHA-dFdC in controlling the tumor growth. In addition, histology evaluation revealed a high level of apoptosis and tumor encapsulation in tumors in mice treated with DHA-dFdC-SLNs. DHA-dFdC-SLNs represents a new DHA-dFdC formulation with improved antitumor activity.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Solid lipid nanoparticles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Solubility"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stability"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Antitumor activity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cytotoxicity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Plasma pharmacokinetics"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517319306544", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517319306544", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85071664584", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85071664584", "pubmed-id": "31415878", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071664584", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190812", "$": "2019-08-12"}}}}}
