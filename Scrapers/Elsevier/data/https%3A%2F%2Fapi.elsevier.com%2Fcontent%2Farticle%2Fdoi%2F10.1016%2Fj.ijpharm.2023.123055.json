For this study, poorly soluble fenofibrate was selected as a model drug. From the results of pre-formulation studies, Compritol\u00ae HD5 ATO, Gelucire\u00ae 48/16, and Capmul\u00ae GMO-50 were selected as oil, surfactant and co-surfactant respectively for manufacturing of HME S-SEDDS. Neusilin\u00ae US2 was selected as a solid carrier. The design of experiments (response surface methodology) was employed to prepare formulations via a continuous HME process. The formulations were evaluated for emulsifying properties, crystallinity, stability, flow properties and drug release characteristics. The prepared HME S-SEDDS showed excellent flow properties, and the resultant emulsions were stable. The globule size of the optimized formulation was 269.6\u00a0nm. The DSC and XRD studies revealed the amorphous nature of the formulation and FTIR studies showed no significant interaction between fenofibrate and excipients. The drug release studies showed significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) improvement in solubility compared to the pure drug (DE15\u00a0=\u00a045.04 for the optimized formulation), as\u00a0>90% of drug release was observed within 15\u00a0min. The stability studies for the optimized formulation were conducted for 3\u00a0months at 40\u00a0\u00b0C/75% RH.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Solid self-emulsifying drug delivery systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hot-melt extrusion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Continuous manufacturing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Solubility enhancement"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interfacial tension"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517323004751", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517323004751", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85160570329", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85160570329", "pubmed-id": "37207857", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160570329", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20230518", "$": "2023-05-18"}}}}}
