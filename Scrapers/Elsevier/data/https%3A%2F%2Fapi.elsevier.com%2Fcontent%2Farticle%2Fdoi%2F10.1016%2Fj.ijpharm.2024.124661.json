Lewisite rapidly penetrates the skin, causing inflammation and blistering. This study focuses on developing a cream formulation of a therapeutic agent, called integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB), to treat lewisite-induced injuries. Moreover, animal studies demonstrate a molecular target engagement (ISR) and significant efficacy of ISRIB against lewisite-induced cutaneous injury. The goal of this formulation is to enhance the delivery of ISRIB directly to affected skin areas using an oil-in-water cream emulsion system. We investigated various excipients, including oils, surfactants, emollients, and permeation enhancers, to optimize ISRIB\u2019s solubility and penetration through the skin. The result of this study indicated that the optimal formulation includes 30\u00a0% w/w of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide and Azone\u00ae at a pH of 5. 5. It delivered the highest amount of ISRIB into the skin, demonstrating highest skin absorption with no detectable systemic exposure. Additionally, characterization of the cream, including texture analysis, emulsion type, and content uniformity, confirmed its\u2019 suitability for topical application. These findings suggest that ISRIB cream formulation is a promising approach for the localized treatment of skin injuries caused by lewisite.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "ISRIB"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Topical drug delivery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cream formulation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chemical enhancers"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "pH optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lewisite"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pharmaceutical formulation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517324008950", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517324008950", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85203640808", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85203640808", "pubmed-id": "39244069", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85203640808", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20240906", "$": "2024-09-06"}}}}}
