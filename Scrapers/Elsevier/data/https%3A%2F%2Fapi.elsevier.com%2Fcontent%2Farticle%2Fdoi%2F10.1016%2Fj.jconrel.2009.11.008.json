Based on the previous formulation, liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD), which was a DNA\u2013protamine complex wrapped by cationic liposome followed by post-insertion of PEG, LCP was similar to LPD NP except that the core was replaced by a biodegradable nano-sized calcium phosphate precipitate prepared by using water-in-oil micro-emulsions in which siRNA was entrapped. We hypothesized that after entering the cells, LCP would de-assemble at low pH in the endosome, which would cause endosome swelling and bursting to release the entrapped siRNA. Such a mechanism was demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration as shown by using a calcium specific dye Fura-2. The LCP NP was further modified by post-insertion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without anisamide, a sigma-1 receptor ligand for systemic administration. Luciferase siRNA was used to evaluate the gene silencing effect in H-460 cells which were stably transduced with a luciferase gene. The anisamide modified LCP NP silenced about 70% and 50% of luciferase activity for the tumor cells in culture and those grown in a xenograft model, respectively. The untargeted NP showed a very low silencing effect. The new formulation improved the in vitro silencing effect 3\u20134 folds compared to the previous LPD formulation, but had a negligible immunotoxicity.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Calcium phosphate"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nanoparticle"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cancer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PEGylation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "siRNA"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365909007846", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365909007846", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77349109732", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77349109732", "pubmed-id": "19919845", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77349109732", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20091115", "$": "2009-11-15"}}}}}
