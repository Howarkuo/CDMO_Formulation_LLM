Abstract
Background: Methimazole, an oral antithyroid drug, has recently gained attention for 
its skin- brightening effects when applied topically to treat melasma. This study aims 
to develop, optimize, and characterize a methimazole microemulsion as a novel, safe 
approach for local melasma treatment.
Materials and Methods: We prepared microemulsion formulations containing 3% me -
thimazole by combining appropriate amounts of surfactants (Tween 80 and Span 20), 
propylene glycol cosurfactant, and an oil phase (oleic acid-  transcutol p at a 1:10 ratio). 
We then assessed droplet size, stability, viscosity, and skin permeation using rat skin 
models.
Results: The microemulsions' droplet sizes ranged from 7.06 to 28.13 nm, with viscosi-
ties between 120 and 254 centipoises. Our analysis identified droplet size, viscosity, 
and membrane release as significant independent variables. We determined the per -
meability parameters of the optimal formulation through rat skin, including steady- 
state permeability rate (J ss), permeability coefficient (p), lag time (T lag), and apparent 
diffusion coefficient (D app).
Conclusion: We found that the microemulsions' characteristics, physicochemical 
properties, and in vitro release depended on the surfactant-  to- cosurfactant ratio, 
water content, and oil content. We developed an optimal formulation with a high 
surfactant- to- cosurfactant ratio and low water and oil percentages. This formulation 
shows potential for commercialization and manufacturing of final products.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Melanogenesis is a complex physiological process resulting in the 
production of melanin, a pigmented biopolymer derived from tyro -
sine. Melanin is synthesized in melanosomes, organelles related to 
lysosomes in melanocytes, and protects the skin from the harmful 
effects of sunlight, toxic drugs, and chemicals. 1,2
Besides determining skin color and influencing appearance, ab -
normally high melanin production can lead to hyperpigmentation 
disorders. While usually harmless, increased pigmentation, espe-
cially on the face (such as melasma and freckles), can significantly 
impact a person's appearance. This may cause emotional and psy -
chological distress, affecting quality of life. Melasma, a common 
acquired hypermelanosis, typically occurs in sun-  exposed areas, pri -
marily on the face, occasionally on the neck, and rarely on the arms. 3
Melasma treatments focus on protection from ultraviolet rays and 
reducing epidermal melanin. Hydroquinone (HQ) is the primary ingre-
dient in topical agents for hyperpigmentation disorders. However, HQ 
often causes side effects and has cytotoxic and mutagenic effects.4
Methimazole (1- methyl- 2- mercaptoimidazole), with the molecular 
formula C4H6N2S, is a thioamide that inhibits the thyroid peroxidase 
enzyme. It has antithyroid activity and is used to treat hyperthyroid -
ism.5 Side effects of methimazole include toxicity and liver damage.6
When applied topically, methimazole inhibits skin melanin pro-
duction, acting as a depigmenting agent in both laboratory animals 
and humans. It interferes with various stages of eumelanin and phe -
omelanin synthesis by inhibiting peroxidase in skin melanocytes and 
blocking the metabolism of several melanin mediators, including di -
hydroxyphenylalanine, dihydroxyindole, and benzothiazine. 7 Unlike 
hydroquinone, topical methimazole has no cytotoxic or mutagenic 
effects and does not affect plasma thyroid hormone levels. 8
Applying drugs to the skin is a method of drug delivery that aims 
to achieve both local and systemic effects. This approach offers 
several advantages, such as avoiding first-  pass hepatic metabolism, 
providing continuous and controlled drug delivery, reducing dosing 
frequency, and increasing patient acceptance. 9
Microemulsions (MEs) are stable colloidal systems with droplet 
sizes smaller than 100 nm. They consist of oil and water stabilized by a 
mixture of surfactants and cosurfactants.10 As liquid and isotropic for-
mulations, MEs have been extensively studied as drug delivery systems 
for various routes, including skin application. Their advantages over 
conventional unstable emulsions include ease of preparation, thermo-
dynamic stability, enhanced penetration, and transparency.11
This research aims to develop an ME pharmaceutical form of 
methimazole with appropriate therapeutic efficiency, designed to 
increase the drug's effectiveness and stability at the target site.
2  | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  Materials
The following materials were obtained for this study: methimazole 
(Iran Hormon Company); propylene glycol, Span 20, Tween 80, oleic 
acid, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium hydrogen phos -
phate (Merck, Germany); Transcutol P (Gattefosse, Germany); and 
cellulose membrane (Armaghan Kala Jounob Company, Iran).
2.2  |  Animals
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jundishapur 
University of Medical Sciences (IR.AJUMS.ABHC.REC.1397.087) on 
March 13, 2019. Adult male Wistar rats (150–170 g, 10–12 weeks old) 
were used. The rats were anesthetized and euthanized using keta -
mine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). After confirming death, 
abdominal hair was removed using an electric shaver. The abdomi -
nal skin was carefully excised using scissors and tweezers. Healthy- 
looking skin samples were cleaned of fat using cold acetone-  soaked 
cotton. Skin thickness was measured with a digital micrometer. The 
samples were then wrapped in aluminum foil, labeled with diameter 
and preparation date, and stored below −20°C. 12
2.3  |  Methimazole measurement
A spectrophotometer was used to measure methimazole at 251 nm. 
This wavelength was selected based on methimazole's absorption 
spectrum in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), where it showed maximum 
absorption without interference from other substances. 13,14

2.4  |  Phase diagram
Pseudo- ternary phase diagrams were created based on previous 
studies. The components included:
• Surfactants: Span 20 (HLB 8.6) and Tween 80 (HLB 15).
• Cosurfactant: Propylene glycol.
• Oil phase: Oleic acid and Transcutol P (ratios 3:1 and 2:1).
Using factorial design and pre-  formulation trials, eight formula -
tions were selected with three variables at two levels each ( Table 1). 
The variables were:
• Surfactant to cosurfactant ratio (3:1 and 1:2).
• Oil proportion (5% and 50%).
• Water content (5% and 10%).
Each formulation contained 3% of the drug. Figure 1 shows the 
phase diagram used in this study. 15
Using a factorial design and pre-  formulation tests, we selected 
eight formulations based on three variables, each at two levels 
(Table 1). The variables in this study were:
• Surfactant to cosurfactant ratio (3:1 and 2:1).
• Oil percentage (5% and 50%).
• Water content (5% and 10%).
We added 3% of the drug to each formulation and conducted 
analyses.15
2.5  |  MEs preparation
We prepared methimazole-  containing MEs by first adding the drug 
to the oil mixture, and then combining this with the surfactant and 
cosurfactant mixture. We then added distilled water dropwise while 
stirring to obtain the final ME. 16
2.6  |  Evaluation of ME droplet size
We analyzed the droplet size of each ME using a Particle Size 
Analyzer. The average droplet size and dispersion index were meas -
ured by Laser Light Scattering at 25°C. 17
2.7  |  Evaluation of viscosity and pH of 
drug- containing samples
We measured the viscosity of selected samples at 25°C using a 
Brookfield viscometer model DV-  II with spindle 34. Measurements 
were taken in 10 mL volumes at shear speeds of 50, 75, and 100 rpm.18
We measured pH using a Mettler pH meter at 25°C without 
dilution.19
2.8  |  Evaluation of ME stability
We prepared 5 mL volumes of several formulations and stored them at 
4°C, 25°C, and 37°C for 6 months. We visually examined the samples

weekly for phase separation, transparency, and sediment formation. Any 
changes, such as turbidity or phase separation, indicated instability.20
2.9  |  Evaluation of drug release
We used a standing Franz diffusion chamber (cross-  sectional area: 
4.906 cm2) to assess drug release from different formulations. We 
used phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as the receiving phase and a cellulose 
synthetic membrane (soaked in deionized water for 24 h before use) 
as the membrane model.
We filled the receiver chamber with 35 mL of receiving phase and 
placed it on a stirrer at 37 ± 0.5°C, with a magnet at 200 rpm. We 
spread 5 g of each formulation on the membrane. At regular intervals 
(0.5, 1, 2, … 8, and 24 h), we removed 2 mL from the receiver chamber 
and replaced it with a fresh solution. We determined the amount of 
released drug using spectrophotometry at 251 nm. 12
2.10  |  Evaluation of methimazole permeation 
through rat skin
To assess skin permeability, we placed 5 g of ME formulation on hy -
drated rat skin in the donor phase of Franz cells. We filled the receiver 
phase with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stirred it at 200 rpm. We sam-
pled the receiver phase at designated times (0.5, 1, 2, … 8, and 24 h), 
removing 2 mL and replacing it with fresh buffer to maintain sink con-
ditions. We measured drug permeation spectroscopically at 251 nm, 
using a 3% aqueous suspension of methimazole as a control (Figure 2).18
We investigated methimazole permeation from MEs through 
whole rat skin and calculated permeation parameters including 
steady- state permeability rate (Jss), permeability coefficient (p), lag 
time (Tlag), and apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) ( Table 2). We 
also calculated ERflux, ERD, and ERp of drug-  containing MEs com -
pared to the drug-  saturated control ( Table 2).
To calculate permeability parameters, we plotted the cumulative 
amount of drug permeated per unit area against time. We obtained 
Jss by multiplying the permeability coefficient (p) by the drug con -
centration in the donor phase (C). We calculated the apparent diffu -
sion coefficient (Dapp) by dividing the square of the skin diameter (h) 
by 6 times the lag time (T lag).15,21
Since h doesn't represent the actual drug passage length, D cal -
culated from this formula is apparent. As all calculations were based 
on the steady-  state region of the cumulative drug permeability dia -
gram, sink conditions were necessary for reliable parameters. In this 
study, the maximum concentration in the receptor phase was less 
than 10% of the drug's saturated solubility, ensuring a constant con -
centration gradient and passage rate during experiments. 15
2.11  |  Statistical analysis
We repeated all experiments three times and expressed values as 
means with standard deviations. We used two-  sided t- tests and 
analysis of variance for statistical analysis, with significance set at 
p < 0.05. We designed the Full-  Factorial test using Minitab 16 soft -
ware. We calculated the optimal formulation using the optimization 
method in Minitab 16. 15

methimazole MEs
Table 2 shows the physicochemical characteristics of methimazole-  
containing MEs. These include:

2. Polydispersity index.
3. Viscosity at three different shear rates.
4. pH on the day of manufacture and after 6 months (stability).
MEs 8 and 4 show the lowest (115 cps) and highest (237 cps) 
viscosity, respectively. The formulations' viscosity correlates sig -
nificantly with oil percentage, water percentage, and surfactant-  to- 
cosurfactant ratio. Viscosity increases when:
1. Oil percentage rises.
2. Water percentage decreases.
3. Surfactant to surfactant-  to- cosurfactant ratio decreases.
The pH of MEs has a strong link to water percentage. As water 
content increases, pH decreases. Our results indicate that ME 3 has 
the highest pH, while ME 1 has the lowest.
3.2  |  Drug Release
Table 3 and Figure 3 present the rate and mechanism of drug release 
from MEs. Our findings show that over 24 h, formulation number 2 
released the highest percentage of the drug, while formulation num -
ber 8 released the lowest.
Variance analysis reveals significant relationships between ME 
ingredients and drug release rates:
2- h drug release:
1. Oil and water percentages significantly affect the 2-  h drug 
release rate.
2. Decreasing the water percentage and increasing the oil percent -
age can boost the 2- h release rate.
3. Formulation 2 shows the highest 2-  h release rate, while formula -
tion 8 shows the lowest.
24- h drug release:
1. Oil and water percentages significantly influence the 24-  h drug 
release rate of methimazole from MEs.
2. Higher oil percentage and lower water percentage in MEs in -
crease the 24- h drug release rate.
3. Formulation 2 (50% oil, 5% water, 45% S +  C) demonstrates the 
highest 24- h release rate.
4. Formulation 8 (50% oil, 10% water, 40% S +  C) shows the lowest 
24- h release rate.
Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the 2 4-  h drug re -
lease percentage from MEs and the independent variables of water 
and oil percentages.
3.3  |  Permeability of methimazole MEs
Table 4 displays the permeability parameters of methimazole ME for -
mulations compared to the drug saturation control using whole rat skin.
Our findings indicate that the microemulsion carrier increased 
the Jss (steady-  state flux) of all formulations:
• Formulation 7 (50% oil, 5% water, 45% s + c) showed the highest Jss.
• Formulation 1 (50% oil, 10% water, 40% s + c) had the lowest Jss.
The microemulsion carrier's effect on D (diffusion coefficient) 
varied among formulations:
• Formulation 4 exhibited the highest D value.
• Formulation 5 had the lowest D value.
3.4  |  Stability
We evaluated the stability of ME samples after 6 months of storage 
at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C. Our observations revealed:
• No turbidity, precipitation, or phase separation in any samples.
• Drug content remained at 99.9%, indicating high chemical 
stability.
• Minimal changes in droplet size and pH, which did not signifi -
cantly affect the results.

Note: Methimazole ME number 3 has the largest droplet size, while ME number 6 has the smallest. We found a significant relationship between 
droplet size and both the surfactant-  to- cosurfactant ratio and oil percentage. As these ratios increase, so does the droplet size.

3.5  |  Optimal formulation
We used Minitab 16 statistical software to determine the optimal 
formulation through an optimization method. This process focused 
on two key factors:
• Droplet size.
• Percentage of drug release after 24 h.
We chose these factors as the most valid and effective data 
points. The method involved:
• Calculating the range between the lowest and highest data for 
each variable.
• Setting this range as the target.
• Identifying the best percentage for each phase that yielded our 
target values for particle size and 24-  h drug release.
The resulting combination was designated as the optimal formu -
lation. Table 5 presents the optimization results:
The optimal formulation of 3% methimazole was prepared using 
the values from the table. Its characteristics, including particle size 
and drug release percentage after 24 h (24% R), were measured. 
Table 6 presents these results.
Variance analysis of the equation relating the formulation's par -
ticle size to independent variables is:
Droplet Size (nm) = −2.5 − 1.22 (%w) + 0.439 (%oil) + 12.2 (s/c).
This equation reveals a significant relationship between particle 
size, oil percentage, and the surfactant-  to- cosurfactant ratio. As the 
oil percentage and surfactant to cosurfactant ratio increase, so does 
particle size.
The equation linking the 24-  h drug release percentage to inde -
pendent variables is:
24- h release (%) = 66.9–0.559 (%w) + 0.201 (%oil) − 2.69 (s/c).
This relationship indicates a significant connection between 
drug release percentage and oil and water percentages. The drug re-
lease rate rises with increasing oil percentage and decreasing water 
percentage.
We inserted the independent variable values from the optimi -
zation process into each equation to obtain the calculated value for

each variable. These calculated values were then compared with the 
actual measured values.
Table 7 displays the calculated and real values, along with the 
regression p- value for each variable.
The presented equations describing the relationship between 
droplet size characteristics and 24-  h drug release with independent 
variables show sufficient validity based on these results. The opti -
mal formulation with suitable features has an optimization factor 
D equal to 1 for both droplet size variables and 24-  h release. This 
suggests that the optimal formulation is appropriate for conducting 
further tests in this study.
However, no significant relationship was found between the par -
ticle size and the 24- h release of the optimal formula with calculated 
values.
We also examined the permeation rate of methimazole in the 
optimal pharmaceutical microemulsion through whole rat skin. 
Permeation parameters including J ss, p, T lag, and D app were calcu -
lated. Table 5 (ME- Optimal) presents these results. Additionally, we 
compared the ER flux, ERD, and ERp of the optimal formulation to the 
water control (ME-  Optimal).
To determine permeability parameters, we plotted the cumula -
tive amount of drug passed through the surface unit against time 
(Figure 5).
4  | DISCUSSION
Methimazole, an anti-  hyperthyroid drug, acts as a depigmenta -
tion agent when applied topically by inhibiting peroxidase in skin 
melanocytes and preventing melanin production. 7 Research by 
Kasraee et al. in 2008 showed that long-  term topical use of me -
thimazole does not significantly affect serum thyroid hormone 
levels. Its minimal skin side effects and lack of cytotoxicity or 
mutagenicity make it a safe option for treating hyperpigmenta -
tion disorders. 22 A subsequent study by Kasraee et  al. found that 
daily application of 5% methimazole cream for 6 weeks reduced

SALIMI et al.
epidermal melanin in guinea pigs, suggesting its potential for im -
proving hyperpigmented skin lesions. 23
Our microemulsion evaluation revealed droplet sizes ranging 
from 9.33 to 47 nm, with dispersion indices below 0.5, indicating 
uniform droplet sizes across all formulations. Droplet size showed 
a significant positive correlation with oil percentage and s/c ratio.
Microemulsion viscosity ranged from 115 to 237 centipoise at 
75 rpm shear speed. Viscosity increased significantly with higher 
oil percentage, lower water percentage, and reduced s/c ratio. 
Viscosity plays a crucial role in drug penetration through the skin 
and formulation stability. The formulations' rheological behavior 
at various shear rates appeared to follow Newtonian principles. 
Yuan et al. emphasized the importance of water, oil, and surfactant 
components in MEs. 24
The pH of the prepared MEs ranged from 4.30 to 4.66, show -
ing a significant inverse relationship with water percentage. 
Comparatively, Salimi et al. reported a pH of about 6.5 for celecoxib 
MEs using similar components. 25 The same researchers found a 
pH of around 5.1 for azithromycin formulations. 26 Mohammad 
Soleymani et al. reported a pH of about 5.4 for finasteride MEs with 
similar components. 15 Kalantari et al. noted a pH of 4.8 for sour 
cherry kernel extract MEs. 27
The drug release results after 2 and 24 h revealed significant rela-
tionships with water and oil percentages. Higher oil percentage and 
lower water percentage increased drug release rates at both time 
points. Formulation 2 showed the highest 24-  h drug release, while 
formulation 8 had the lowest. All formulations followed Higuchi 
model kinetics, indicating diffusion-  controlled release. This suggests 
that the rate-  limiting step for methimazole release from MEs is its 
release from oil droplets. 28
MEs significantly increased ERflux, ERP, and ERD compared to 
the control (3% drug suspension) in rat skin permeation studies. 
However, Jss, P, incubation time, and Dapp showed no significant 
relationship with independent variables within the studied range. 
Increased drug permeability due to higher oil content may be at -
tributed to oleic acid's absorption-  enhancing properties. Oleic acid 
disrupts stratum corneum lipid structure, increasing fluidity and 
penetration. 29–31 It primarily enhances permeability through the 
non- polar path by increasing both diffusion and absorption. 32,33 
Oleic acid may also lower the lipid binding temperature, dissolving 
stratum corneum lipids. 34
The microemulsion structure, particularly the increased oil phase 
and surfactant content, had a greater impact on flux and p values. 
This effect likely results from lipid matrix liquefaction or corneal 
tissue lipid structure disruption by oleic acid and the formulation's 
surfactant system. 15
Previous studies have shown that unsaturated fatty acids, espe -
cially those with more double bonds and cis spatial arrangements, 
have stronger enhancing effects than saturated fatty acids. Oleic 
acid's unsaturated bond with a cis arrangement induces disorder in 
the intercellular bilayer structure, reducing the gel to liquid crystal 
transition temperature. 35
Propylene glycol accelerates drug distribution in the stratum cor -
neum and slightly disrupts cellular lipid structure. Using 10% propyl -
ene glycol with oleic acid enhances the permeation effect. 34 It acts 
by solvating keratin in the stratum corneum and occupying hydrogen 
bonding sites. 36
Non- ionic surfactants alter drug distribution in the skin 37 and 
increase penetration by dissolving stratum corneum lipids. 38 Their 
protein- binding ability in the stratum corneum enhances absorption 
properties and interferes with keratin cells. Span20, a non-  ionic sur-
factant, is a strong skin permeation enhancer. 15

This study demonstrates that alterations in microemulsion content 
and composition significantly influence the physicochemical char -
acteristics and permeability parameters of drugs in microemul -
sion formulations during rat skin penetration. The microemulsion
