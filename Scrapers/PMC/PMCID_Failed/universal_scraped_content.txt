Paclitaxel (P AC) is one of the most effective antineoplastic
agents used to treat a wide range of tumors, including refrac-
tory ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, non-small cell
lung cancer, head and neck cancer and AIDS-related Ka-
posi’ s sarcoma.
1,2) It is a taxane that interferes with micro-
tubule depolymerization in tumor cells resulting in an arrest
of the cell cycle in mitosis followed by the induction of apop-
tosis. P AC has brought much hope to people with cancer, but
its poor solubility has limited its clinical application.
3)
At present, many generic P AC-based products that are
suitable for formulation as an intravenous infusion, besides
the ﬁrst patented P AC named Taxol, are available on the mar-
ket. However, all these products contain Cremophor as a sol-
ubilizer. Cremophor is allegedly responsible for many pacli-
taxel-associated hypersensitivity reactions,
4—6) which may
prove to be fatal to patients. In addition, this formulation has
been associated with a number of issues, such as sterilization
by ﬁltration, the possibility for drug precipitation upon dilu-
tion, ﬁltering requirements and the use of non-plasticized
containers and administration sets.
1) Therefore, it is very 
important to develop a new intravenous dosage form of P AC
with improved solubility and in formulations devoid of 
Cremophor.
An intravenous emulsion stabilized with amphipathic
lipids is an appealing alternative as a drug carrier for anti-
cancer drug delivery. The potential pharmaceutical applica-
tions include use as a carrier for lipophilic drugs
7—11) and for
site-speciﬁc drug delivery by attaching ligands for various
cell surface receptors to the particle surface.
12) Generally, in-
travenous emulsions are biodegradable, biocompatible, phys-
ically stable, easy to scale up and cost effective when com-
pared to other drug carriers. In addition, lipophilic drugs can
be incorporated into the interior oil phase to sequester them
from direct contact with exterior water and oxygen. Thus, for
some drugs, emulsions could afford a better chemical stabil-
ity. However, emulsions based largely on vegetable oils are
unsuitable for P AC, because P AC does not show a sufﬁciently
high solubility in registered oils ( e.g., long-chain triglyceride
(LCT) in the form of soybean oil, medium-chain triglyceride
(MCT) or a mixture of LCT and MCT).
As reported in the literature, several emulsion formula-
tions, such as using surfactants which were not clinically ac-
cepted in intravenous applications,
13,14) adding excess amount
of oils 15) or adopting organic solvents as co-solvents, 16,17)
have successfully resolved the problem of the solubility of
P AC in the oil phase. However, none of these emulsion for-
mulations have been introduced into clinical practice because
of the lack of sufﬁcient biocompatibility and stability
14,15,18,19)
to meet the requirements of clinical applications and indus-
trial-scale production.
The objective of this paper was to prepare a novel Cre-
mophor-free, autoclave stable, intravenous emulsion for 
paclitaxel (P ACE). A paclitaxel–cholesterol complex was
adopted as the drug carrier to improve the solubility and 
entrapment efﬁciency of paclitaxel in the oil phase of the
emulsions. All the excipients used in the P ACE formulation
were clinically acceptable and approved for use in intra-
venous infusion by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). 
The complex and P ACE used in this study were pre-
pared by conventional rotary evaporation and high-pressure
homogenization, respectively. The formulation, its character-
ization and the hypersensitivity evaluation were investigated
to describe the formulation in detail.

The objective of this paper was to develop a novel Cremophor-free, autoclave stable, intravenous emulsion
for paclitaxel (P ACE). A paclitaxel–cholesterol complex was used as the drug carrier to improve the solubility of
paclitaxel in the oil phase of emulsions. The complex and P ACE were prepared by rotary evaporation and high-
pressure homogenization, respectively. Effects of oil phases, emulsiﬁers and pH values on the characteristics of
P ACE were investigated. P ACE was characterized with regard to its appearance, morphology, osmolality, pH
value, particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efﬁciency and stability. Hypersensitivity was evaluated by
guinea pig hypersensitivity reaction. The ﬁnal formulation was composed of the complex, soybean oil, medium-
chain triglyceridel, soybean lecithin, poloxamer 188 and glycerol. The resulting P ACE had an encapsulation efﬁ-
ciency of 97.3% with a particle size of 135 nm and a zeta potential of /H1154638.3 mV . Osmolality and pH of the formu-
lation were 383 mOsmol/kg and 4.5, respectively. The formulation survived autoclaving at 115 °C for 30 min and
remained stable for at least 12 months at 6 °C. P ACE also exhibited a better tolerance than an equal dose of 
Cremophor-based paclitaxel injection in guinea pigs, as no obvious hypersensitivity reaction was observed. These 
results suggested that P ACE has a great potential for industrial-scale production and clinical applications.

tee of the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical

Solubility of P AC in Oils The solubility of P AC was determined in 
soybean oil and LCT/MCT. Excess P AC was added into 5 ml of oils in a 
centrifuge tube and mixed (100 rpm) in a shaking incubator at 60 °C for 5 h.
The solutions were then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min to remove the
excess P AC, and the concentrations of P AC in the supernatant were meas-
ured by HPLC after appropriate dilution with ethanol.
Preparation of Paclitaxel–Cholesterol Complex The paclitaxel–
cholesterol complex was prepared by a rotary evaporation method. The 
required amount of paclitaxel and cholesterol were put in a round bottom
ﬂask and reaction solvent was added. The mixture was reﬂuxed at 40 °C for
1.5 h. Then, the settled solution was evaporated to obtain the dried pacli-
taxel–cholesterol complex. Paclitaxel, cholesterol and the dried paclitaxel–
cholesterol complex were weighed on an electronic balance before and after
reaction to make sure the reaction solvent had been completely evaporated.
Preparation of Paclitaxel Emulsion (P ACE) and Blank P ACE The
drug-loading of P ACE was initially set at 1.0 mg/ml. P ACE was prepared by
high-pressure homogenization. At ﬁrst, the P AC–cholesterol complex was
dissolved in 20% MCT/LCT at 60 °C. Next, the aqueous phase consisting of
soybean lecithin, poloxamer 188 and glycerol was uniformly dispersed at
60 °C in a water bath. Then, the coarse emulsion was prepared at 60 °C with
high shear mixing using a Fluko homogenizer FA25 model (Fluko Equip-
ment Shanghai Co., Ltd., China) by rapidly adding the oil phase to the aque-
ous phase at 10000 rpm. The high shear mixing process was carried out for
10 min at 19000 rpm and the ﬁnal emulsion was obtained by high-pressure
homogenization using Niro Soavi NS 1001L2K homogenization equipment
(Niro Soavi S.p.A., Via M.da Erba Edoari, 29/A-43100 Parma, Italy) at
80 MPa for 7 cycles. The temperature of the whole homogenization process
was maintained below 40 °C in a cycle ice-water bath. The pH value was 
adjusted to 4.5 with 0.1
M hydrochloric acid and the emulsion was ﬁnally
transferred to vials and autoclaved at 115 °C for 30 min. Blank P ACE (with-
out drug) was prepared by the same method as P ACE.
Preparation of Cremophor-Based Paclitaxel Solution (P ACS) and
Blank Paclitaxel Solution (Blank P ACS) Each 1 ml of paclitaxel injec-
tion contained paclitaxel (6 mg), Cremophor (50% v/v) and anhydrous
ethanol (50% v/v). Blank paclitaxel injection (without drug) was prepared in
accordance with the formulation for paclitaxel injection and was subject to
sterile ﬁltration through a 0.22
mm microporous membrane. P ACS and blank
P ACS were prepared before administration by diluting paclitaxel injection
and blank paclitaxel injection with sodium chloride injection (0.9%) to 
obtain the same concentration as P ACE, respectively.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) The DSC analysis was 
performed with a SII EXSTR6000 series DSC-6200 (Seiko Instruments Inc.,
Japan). Samples were sealed in aluminum pan and heated at a rate of
10 °C/min from 25 to 300 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The peak transition
maximum temperatures of paclitaxel, cholesterol, the complex of paclitaxel
and cholesterol, and the physical mixture of paclitaxel and cholesterol at the
same ratio as the complex were determined and compared using a DSC
Analysis (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan).
Morphology For transmission electron microscopy, the samples were
placed on specimen mesh copper grids. After drying at room temperature,
the grid containing the P ACE sample as a dry ﬁlm was placed on the sample
holder and observed with an H-7650 transmission electron microscope
(Hitichi, Japan).
Osmolality and pH Measurement Measurement of the P ACE osmolal-
ity was based on the freezing-point method. After calibration of a SMC 30B
Osmometer (Tianjin Tianhe Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) with refer-
ence standards, the osmolality was recorded with the real sample. The pH
was measured using a calibrated F-20 pH/mV meter (Beijing Yiyuan Elec-
tronic Instrument Technology Co., China).
Particle Size and Zeta Potential The particle size of P ACE was meas-
ured by laser light scattering using a Master sizer 2000 (Malvern Instru-
ments Corp., U.K.) after appropriate dilution with double-distilled water. For
the zeta potential, samples were diluted with double-distilled water and ana-
lyzed by dynamic light scattering using a Nano-ZS 90 Zetasizer (Malvern
Instruments Corp., U.K.).
Entrapment Efﬁciency The encapsulation efﬁciency of the P ACE 
formulation was determined by measuring free P AC in the aqueous phase.
P ACE was subjected to a Hitachi ultracentrifuge operated at 40000 rpm for
4 h at 15 °C. The concentration of P AC in the aqueous phase was then esti-
mated using HPLC. Entrapment efﬁciency was calculated using the formula
entrapment efﬁciency (%) /H11005[(W
initial/H11002Wobtained)/Winitial]/H11003100, where Winitial is
the amount of drug present initially in the formulation and Wobtained is the 
estimated amount in the aqueous phase of the formulation.
Stability The autoclaving stability was performed at 115 °C for 30 min.
The long-term storage stability was performed at 30 °C for 3 months and
6 °C for 12 months, respectively. The appearance, pH value, particle size,
content and related substances were used as the main parameters to evaluate
the physicochemical stability of P ACE.
Content and Related Substances Analysis One milliliter of P ACE
sample was placed in a volumetric ﬂask and diluted with ethanol to obtain
sample solutions and control solutions at concentrations of 40
mg/ml and
0.4 mg/ml, respectively. To obtain standard solutions at the concentration of
40 mg/ml, accurately weighed quantities of P AC reference substance were
dissolved in ethanol. T wenty microliters of control solution was then 
injected into an HPLC, the chromatogram was recorded, and the scale was
adjusted so that the P AC peak was 15—20% of the full chromatogram. Next,
20
ml of both the sample solution and the standard solution were injected
into the HPLC and the peak areas were recorded. The content of P ACE sam-
ple was then calculated by the external standard method and the related 
substances were calculated by the normalization method. Drug assay was
determined by reverse phase HPLC using a Kromasil-C18 column (250 /H11003
4.6 mm, 5
mm) and a C18 pre-column of the same packing (12.5 mm /H11003
4.6 mm). The mobile phase involved acetonitrile and water (54 : 46), applied
at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 230 nm.
Hypersensitivity Reaction Thirty guinea pigs (300/H1100620 g) were used
for hypersensitivity studies. The animals were acclimatized at a temperature
of 25/H110062 °C and a relative humidity of 70/H110065% under natural light/dark con-
ditions for at least one week before experimentation. The animals were fed a
standard diet and allowed water ad libitum. Before administration, they were
randomly divided into ﬁve experimental groups. Each group consisted of six
guinea pigs, three of which were male and the other three female. These
groups were divided as follows: Group 1: positive control group (5% ovalbu-
min solution); Group 2: P ACE group (1 mg/ml); Group 3: P ACE negative
control group (blank P ACE); Group 4: P ACS group (1 mg/ml); Group 5:
P ACS negative control group (blank P ACS). Every other day, 0.5 ml of the
formulations (an allergen dose of 2 mg/kg) was intraperitonealy injected, and
this was repeated three times. On the 12th day after the ﬁrst injection, ani-
mals in each group were given a 1.5 ml intravenous (i.v.) dose of the corre-
sponding formulation (a challenge dose of 6 mg/kg). The animals were then
monitored for 3 h after the challenge injection in order to observe the aller-
gic reaction symptoms. According to the guideline of allergic reaction
grades in guinea pigs,
20) we evaluated the hypersensitivity grade of the ﬁve
groups as Grade 0 (negative): normal; Grade 1 (weakly positive): distur-
bance, erect hair, shaking, nose scratching; Grade 2 (positive): sneezing,
coughing, shortness of breath, urination, defecation, being in tears; Grade 3
(strong positive): dyspnea, wheeze, purpura, unsteady gait, jumping, gasp,
spasm, rotation, tidal breathing; Grade 4 (extremely strong positive): death.
Results and Discussion
Solubility of P AC in Oils The generally accepted dose
of paclitaxel for clinical applications has been 135—
250 mg/m2.1) Based on this dose, a drug-loading of 0.8 mg/ml
or above was required for P ACE to have a total volume below
500 ml. According to the solubility of paclitaxel in a 20% oil
phase formulation, however, its concentration should reach at
least 4 mg/ml. Despite this, the low solubility of paclitaxel,
0.3 mg/ml in the soybean oil and 1.0 mg/ml in LCT/MCT,
322 V ol. 59, No. 3
made it impossible for a direct preparation of these emul-
sions (Table 1). Therefore, it was essential to enhance the
solubility of paclitaxel in the oil phase.
Investigations of Paclitaxel–Cholesterol Complex As
reported in the literature, the formation of a complex be-
tween a drug and lipids could improve the physicochemical
properties of the drug, especially its liposolubility.
21,22) In this
paper, paclitaxel–lipid complexes were prepared to improve
the solubility of paclitaxel in the oil phase of emulsions. S75,
E80, cholesterol, DMPC, DMPG, SPC-3 and DSPG were
adopted as lipid materials to optimize paclitaxel–lipid com-
plexes. According to the solubility results of paclitaxel in oils
(Table 1), LCT/MCT showed increased solubility for P AC,
which might be due to the higher polarity of MCT compared
with LCT and resulting in an increased drug uptake capabil-
ity for MCT. Thus, the selection of the complexes was based
on a comparison of their solubility in LCT/MCT. The results
showed that the solubility of the complexes with S75, E80,
cholesterol, DMPC, DMPG, SPC-3 and DSPG were 0.5, 0.3,
19.8, 0.2, 8.5, 1.0 and 10.2 mg/ml, respectively. Paclitaxel–
cholesterol complex exhibited a higher solubility and a lower
price, and thus the latter was selected as lipid material for
preparation of P ACE and its solubility and stability in oils
were investigated in detail. From Table 1, it can be seen that
the physical mixture of drug and cholesterol at the same ratio
as the complex exhibited a solubility of 0.3 mg/ml in soybean
oil and 1.2 mg/ml in LCT/MCT, respectively, which was sim-
ilar to the paclitaxel. Meanwhile, the complex exhibited a
solubility of 8.0 mg/ml in soybean oil and 19.8 mg/ml in
LCT/MCT, respectively. In addition, when the complex was
dissolved in LCT/MCT, it remained stable after autoclaving
at 115 °C for 30 min with no degradation product detected,
whereas degradation products of paclitaxel injection was
23%. Furthermore, the LCT/MCT oil solution of the com-
plex did not precipitation after 4 weeks at 25 °C. These 
results showed that the paclitaxel–cholesterol complex for-
mulation signiﬁcantly increased drug solubility and stability
in the oil phase. Therefore, the paclitaxel–cholesterol com-
plex could be a suitable drug carrier for the paclitaxel emul-
sion preparation.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of Paclitaxel–
Cholesterol Complex DSC is a rapid and reliable method
to analyze the possible interactions between drug and excipi-
ent. Figure 1 shows the DSC curves of paclitaxel (A), choles-
terol (B), a physical mixture of paclitaxel and cholesterol (C)
and the paclitaxel–cholesterol complex (D). P AC and choles-
terol exhibited an endothermal peak at 225.7 °C and
150.9 °C, respectively, which corresponded to the melting
point of P AC and cholesterol. In the DSC curve of the physi-
cal mixture of P AC and cholesterol, there are two endother-
mal peaks. The ﬁrst endothermal peak was at 148.1 °C,
which were almost at the same temperature as the one in the
cholesterol thermogram of 150.9 °C. The second endother-
mal peak was at 205.1 °C, which was lower than the melting
peak of 225.7 °C. This might be because of the fact that
when the temperature rises, P AC and cholesterol partly inter-
act to form a complex. The DSC curve of the P AC–choles-
terol complex shows that the original peaks of P AC and cho-
lesterol have disappeared and a broad endothermal peak at
137.0 °C appeared. This indicated that the complex of P AC
and cholesterol has a lower phase transition temperature than
the individual components. It is evident by comparison of the
four DSC curves that P AC and cholesterol exhibit some 
interactions, such as the formation of hydrogen bonds and
van der Waals forces.
Formulation Development of P ACE An initial formula-
tion of P ACE was composed of 20% LCT/MCT as the oil
phase, soybean lecithin as the emulsiﬁer and poloxamer 188
as the co-emulsiﬁer. The species of oil phase (compared to
soybean oil), the amount of oil phase (compared to 10%) and
the species of emulsiﬁer (compared to egg yolk lecithin) best
suited to optimization were then investigated. The appear-
ance, pH value, particle size, related substances and centrifu-
gal stability test were used as parameters for the optimization
of the formulation. The main optimization results are shown
in Table 2.
As shown in Table 1, using an MCT/LCT mixture pro-
moted the solubility of drug, increasing the entrapment efﬁ-
ciency and reducing the interfacial tension, which in turn had
an effect on the physical and chemical stability of the emul-
sions. It has been reported that the LCT/MCT mixture could
reduce the viscosity of LCT and the particle size distribution
of the emulsion.
23) In addition, excessive oils were not con-
ducive to the stability of the emulsion, leading to a larger
mean particle size. If the amount of oil was too low, however,
it was difﬁcult to meet the drug solubility requirements and

the drug easily leak into the water phase, thereby affecting
the chemical stability of the drugs. 24,25) Similar results were
observed in our experiments as the particle size of the formu-
lation with 20% LCT/MCT was smaller than that of 20%
LCT, but larger than that of 10% LCT/MCT. The amounts of
autoclave degradation products of the formulation with 20%
LCT/MCT, 10% LCT/MCT and 20% LCT were 3.4%, 5.2%
and 14.4%, respectively.
Lecithin is regarded as a well-tolerated and non-toxic com-
pound, making it suitable for long-term use and high-dose 
infusion. The screening results for lecithin species proved
that soybean lecithin exhibited better emulsifying properties.
Additionally, after a regular test of centrifugal stability, a sep-
aration of the oil and water phases occurred and visible oil
droplets were observed in the formulation with the egg yolk
lecithin, but none for the formulation with the soybean
lecithin. Moreover, the formulation with soybean lecithin had
signiﬁcantly less degradation products after autoclaving. This
could be because soybean lecithin contains more phospha-
tidic acid (P A) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) than egg
lecithin, as these charged phospholipid components con-
tributed to more negative potentials and, thus increased the
stability of the emulsions to stress.
26,27) Thus, the optimized
P ACE formulation consisted of 20% LCT/MCT as the oil
core, soybean lecithin as the emulsiﬁer and poloxamer 188 as
the co-emulsiﬁer. Glycerol was also added to maintain the
osmotic pressure of the formulation for intravenous adminis-
tration.
In a series of experiments mentioned above, emulsions
were prepared by a conventional high-pressure homogeniza-
tion method. Based on the optimized formulation, the prepa-
ration process of P ACE was further investigated. Results 
indicated that an 80 MPa homogenization pressure for 7 con-
tinuous cycles resulted in a P ACE with particle sizes less
than 200 nm. Increased pressure and cycle times did not 
improve this result.
Most importantly, although a neutral pH value was impor-
tant to ensure emulsions a high absolute zeta potential
28) and
a low phospholipids and triglycerides hydrolysis, 29—31) PAC
was instable at this pH. Further study showed that, under
acidic pH conditions, the degradation products decreased
with pH values (Table 2). However, when the pH value was
reduced to below 4.0, a precipitate of soybean lecithin 
appeared. This observation was consistent with the fact that
the acidic pH was not conducive to the physical stability of
the emulsion. Hence, a satisfactory pH value (pH 4.0—5.5)
was important for P ACE to survive autoclaving and remain
stable during long-term storage.
Characterization of P ACE For the characterization of
P ACE, the pH was 4.5 and the osmolality was 383 mOsmol/
kg. Transmission electron micrographs of P ACE showed that
the particles were spherical in shape (Fig. 2).
The surface charge (zeta potential) is relevant to the stabil-
ity of the emulsions. P ACE has a high negative zeta potential
of /H1100238.3 mV , which reﬂects the physical stability by prevent-
ing coalescence of droplets upon random collisions.
28) The
mean particle size of P ACE was 135 nm with a size distribu-
tion of approximately 50—300 nm (Fig. 3), and it has been
reported that particles in the 60—400 nm size range can
slowly leak out and accumulate in tumors
32—36) via a passive
mechanism referred to as the ‘enhanced permeability and re-
tention’ (EPR) effect,
37,38) which might be conducive to a bet-
ter cancer treatment.
Drug encapsulation efﬁciency is an important parameter in
colloidal drug delivery systems. High solubility and parti-
tioning of the drug into the oil phase are essential for good
encapsulation efﬁciency of emulsions, which is conducive to
the stability of the drugs.
39) P ACE exhibited an encapsulation
efﬁciency of 97.3%, which proved that the majority of the
P AC remained in the oil phase and oil–water interface of
P ACE.
Stability of P ACE As mentioned above, the stability of
P AC during autoclaving was a key for further P ACE applica-
tions. It has been reported that the autoclaving process might
have caused re-emulsiﬁcation or irreversible redistribution of

emulsiﬁer compounds within the oil and aqueous compart-
ments.40) In addition, environmental stress during the storage
process of emulsions, such as temperature, freezing, light
and intense shaking, could affect the physicochemical stabil-
ity of emulsions.
The effect of autoclaving and long-term storage on P ACE
are shown in Table 3. P ACE prepared according to the ﬁnal
formulation had a uniform milky appearance. After autoclav-
ing at 115 °C for 30 min, the appearance, pH value, particle
size and content were nearly unchanged. As far as the related
substances were concerned, an increase of 0.4% in degrada-
tion impurities after autoclaving compared with the data 
obtained before autoclaving was acceptable based on major
pharmacopoeias, which require related substances below
2%.
41,42)
The results of long-term storage revealed that the samples
stored at 6 °C were stable for 12 months. Variations in the 
appearance, pH value, particle size and content were very
small, whereas an acceptable increase of 1.0% in degradation
impurities was observed. In addition, all other parameters of
P ACE after 12 months were also still within the range 
required for safe intravenous administration. However, the
samples stored at 30 °C for 3 months showed a signiﬁcantly
increase in particle size and related substances, indicating
that room temperature was unsuitable for the storage of
P ACE.
Hypersensitivity Evaluation One of the most important
objectives of this paper was to reduce the hypersensitivity 
reaction caused by Cremophor-based paclitaxel solution. In a
series of pre-experiments, hypersensitivity tests were per-
formed at an allergen dose of 4 mg/kg. From these investiga-
tions, P ACE exhibited a lower toxicity than an equal dose of
Cremophor-based paclitaxel injection. Five guinea pigs out
of six in the P ACS group died during the experimental 
period, whereas only two guinea pigs out of six in the P ACE
group died after the experiments. Based on these pre-experi-
ments, the allergen dose of paclitaxel was reduced to 2 mg/kg
and the challenge dose was set at 6 mg/kg in the formal hy-
persensitivity studies. After challenge, in positive control
group, strong positive allergic reaction symptoms, such as
dyspnea, unsteady gait, gasp, spasm and rotation, were 
observed. Additionally, the P ACS group and the blank P ACS
group caused equally strong positive hypersensitivity reac-
tions. Thus, it could be concluded that the hypersensitivity
reaction of the paclitaxel injection was mainly caused by
Cremophor, which was in accordance with previous reports
already discussed. However, the P ACE group and blank
P ACE group did not respond to the last challenge as the 
hypersensitivity reaction of P ACE and blank P ACE was nega-
tive. Therefore, it could be concluded that P ACE used intra-
venously at a dose of 6 mg/kg did not cause hypersensitivity.
This observation could be explained by the fact that P ACE
and blank P ACE formulations devoid of Cremophor had no
hypersensitivity reactions.
Conclusion
The formation of a paclitaxel–cholesterol complex signiﬁ-
cantly increased the solubility of paclitaxel in the oil phase.
With the complex as drug carrier, a new kind of paclitaxel 
intravenous emulsion was developed. This emulsion was
composed of the complex, LCT/MCT, soybean lecithin,
poloxamer 188 and glycerol. P ACE with high encapsulation
efﬁciency could survive autoclaving at 115 °C for 30 min and
was stable for at least 12 months stored at 6 °C. P ACE also
exhibited a lower toxicity than equal doses of P ACS in
guinea pigs, as no hypersensitivity reactions were observed
for guinea pigs treated with P ACE. Undoubtedly, P ACE has a
great potential for industrial-scale production and clinical 
applications. Further studies are ongoing to determine the
pharmacokinetic, anticancer activity and safety of P ACE.

Lovastatin (LOV) belongs to the class of cholesterol lowering drugs and is the first
clinically used statin. It is a prodrug which lowers the cholesterol level through reversi-
ble competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) re-
ductase, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of cholesterol. It is available as conventio-
nal and extended release tablets, but its low aqueous solubility (4´ 10–4 mg mL–1) finally
escorts it to low oral bioavailability (less than 5 %). In addition, it undergoes extensive
first pass metabolism; as a consequence of hepatic extraction it leads to low and variable
availability of the drug to the general circulation. Therefore improvement in aqueous
solubility of LOV is the foremost aim (1, 2).

Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS)
of lovastatin was aimed at overcoming the problems of
poor solubility and bioavailability. The formulation stra-
tegy included selection of oil phase based on saturated
solubility studies and surfactant and co-surfactant scre-
ening on the basis of their emulsification ability. Ternary
phase diagrams were constructed to identify the self-emul-
sifying region. Capryol 90 (20 %) as oil, Cremophore RH40
(40 %) as surfactant and Transcutol P (40 %) as co-surfac-
tant were concluded to be optimized components. The pre-
pared SMEDDS was characterized through its droplet
size, zeta potential, emulsification time, rheological de-
termination and transmission electron microscopy. The
optimized formulation exhibited 94 %in vitrodrug relea-
se, which was significantly higher than that of the drug
solution. In vivo studies using the Triton-induced hyper-
lipidemia model in Wistar rats revealed considerable re-
duction in lipid levels compared to pure lovastatin. The
study confirmed the potential of lovastatin SMEDDS for
oral administration.

Previous researchers have made attempts to improve the aqueous solubility of LOV
by preparing solid-lipid nanoparticles (1), solid dispersions using modified locust bean
gum as carrier (3), methylated beta-cyclodextrin (4) complex and floating microspheres
(5). Self-microemulsifying formulation of LOV was reported in literature but was not ac-
companied with pharmacodynamic support (2). There is a necessity to develop a formu-
lation that would offer rapid dissolution of LOV and improve its bioavailability and fi-
nally therapeutic efficacy.
Lipid-based formulation approaches, predominantly the self-microemulsifying
drug delivery system (SMEDDS), illustrate their potential as alternative approaches for
the delivery of hydrophobic drugs. Dosing of drug substances that exhibit poor water
solubility but sufficient lipophilic properties in a predissolved state are advantageous in
view of the fact that the energy input allied with a solid-liquid phase transition is cir-
cumvented, thus overcoming the slow dissolution process after oral intake. SMEDDS for-
mulations are isotropic mixtures of an oil, a surfactant, a co-surfactant (solubilizer) and a
drug (6, 7).
LOV is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class II drug with its low
daily oral dose (10–40 mg) and high logP (octanol/water) of 4.3 providing strong justifi-
cation to develop SMEDDS of LOV. The main objective of the study is to develop and
evaluate an optimal SMEDDS formulation containing LOV by using Capryol 90 as oil
and Cremophor RH 40/Transcutol P as surfactant/co-surfactant and to assess its phar-
macodynamic outcome in lipid lowering.
EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals
Lovastatin (LOV) and polyethoxylated castor oil (Capryol® 90) were a kind gift from
Ranbaxy Lab. Ltd. (India). Propylene glycol monocaprylate (Cremophor® RH 40), capryl-
caproyl macrogol glycerides (Labrasol®) and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Trans-
cutol® P) were donated by Gattefosse (India). Triton, castor oil, olive oil, propylene gly-
col, Span 80 and ethanol were purchased from S.D. Fine Chemicals (India). All other che-
micals used were of analytical grade.
Preliminary studies
Screening of oil.– The solubility of LOV in different oils (Capryol 90, olive oil, castor
oil and oleic acid) was determined by the shake flask method in order to screen out the
oil possessing good solubilizing capacity for LOV. An excess amount of LOV was added
to a vial containing 500 mg of each oil. After sealing, the mixture was vortexed using a
vortex mixer for 10 min in order to facilitate proper mixing of LOV with the vehicle.
Mixtures were kept for 72 h at ambient temperature to attain equilibrium and centri-
fuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Aliquots of supernatant were filtered through a membra-
ne filter (0.45mm) and diluted with mobile phase. Drug was quantified directly by using
a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-1700, Japan) atl
max 238 nm.

(2012) 357–370.
Screening of surfactant. – Emulsification ability of various surfactants (Cremophor
RH 40, Labrasol, Span 80) was screened. Surfactant (300 mg) was added to of the se-
lected oily phase (300 mg). The mixture was gently heated at 40–45 °C for 30 seconds to
attain homogenization of components. The mixture, 50 mg, was weighed and diluted
with doubly distilled water to 50 mL to obtain a fine emulsion. The ease of emulsion for-
mation was scrutinized by counting the number of volumetric flask inversions to give a
uniform emulsion and were observed visually for relative turbidity. The resulting emul-
sions were allowed to stand for 2 h and transmittance was observed at 638 nm. The sur-
factant forming a clear emulsion with fewer inversions and higher transmittance was se-
lected (8).
Screening of co-surfactant. – Various co-surfactants (Transcutol P, propylene glycol,
ethanol) were screened for SMEDDS formulation. The screening of co-surfactants was
conducted on the basis of percent transparency and ease of emulsification. Mixtures of
100 mg of co-surfactant, 200 mg of selected surfactant and 300 mg of selected oil phase
were prepared and evaluated in the same manner as described in the above section on
surfactant screening (8).
Drug-excipient interaction.– Fourier transform infra red analysis (FTIR) of pure LOV
and a mixture of LOV with excipients (mixture of surfactant and cosurfactant and oil
phase) was carried out for qualitative compound identification and for drug-excipient
interaction studies. LOV and mixtures were analysed using a Perkin Elmer 1600 spectro-
photometer (RXIFT-IR system, USA). All samples were scanned for absorbance over the
range from 4000–400 cm
–1.
Ternary phase diagram
On the basis of solubility and emulsification studies, Capryol 90, Cremophor RH 40
and Transcutol P were chosen as oil, surfactant and co-surafactant, respectively. To de-
termine the concentration of SMEDDS components that resulted in maximum microemul-
sion existence area, pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed employing the wa-
ter titration method at ambient temperature (25 °C) (9). Mixtures of surfactant and co-
-surfactant (S
mix) in different ratios by mass (1:1, 1:2, 2:1) were prepared. All the mixtu-
res were mixed with oil in different ratios of 1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2 and 9:1 with
a total mass of 1 g. The prepared mixtures were vortexed and then titrated with water
dropwise using a microsyringe under gentle agitation. After each addition, mixtures we-
re observed visually (turbid or clear). Percent of components at which a clear mixture
was formed was figured out by constructing a pseudoternary phase diagram using the
PCP disso software (Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Pune, India).
Formulation of SMEDDS
From the ternary phase diagram, the ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant was opti-
mized. Then, by varying the ratio of oil to optimized ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant,
different formulations were prepared with and without drug. Oil was added to the mix-
ture of surfactant and co-surfactant in ratios (2:8, 2.5:7.5, 3:7, 3.5:6.5, 4:6, 4.5:5.5, 5:5, 5.5:4.5
and 6:4); these formulations were then vortexed for 5–10 min with a vortex shaker until
a clear solution was obtained.

Characterization of SMEDDS
Droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI).– Droplet size analysis and PDI measure-
ment were carried out by dynamic light scattering with a Zetasizer HSA 3000 (Malvern
Instruments Ltd, UK). All samples were subjected to sonication prior to droplet size and
PDI determination.
Zeta potential.– SMEDDS formulations (F21–23) optimized from the droplet size and
PDI estimation were determined using a Zetasizer HSA 3000. These formulations were
subjected to sonication diluted with excess (100 times) double distilled water and then
analysed.
Drug content.– LOV was extracted from the optimised preweighed SMEDDS formu-
lation and dissolved in 25 mL of methanol. The extract was analysed spectrophotometri-
cally against the standard methanolic solution of LOV.
Emulsification time. – Emulsification time of the SMEDDS formulation optimised on
the basis of droplet size was assessed on a USP (10) type II dissolution apparatus (Elec-
trolab, India). Optimized formulation (800 mg) was added dropwise to 500 mL of dis-
tilled water maintained at 37± 0.5 °C. Gentle agitation was provided by a standard stain-
less steel dissolution paddle rotating at 50 rpm. The emulsification time was assessed vi-
sually.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). – The SMEDDS of LOV (F22) was dispersed
in water turning it into a microemulsion; the sample was negatively stained and the mor-
phology of the microemulsion was photographed using a transmission electron micro-
scope (Hitachi H7500, Japan) and the droplet size was observed.
In vitrorelease.–In vitro release of LOV from SMEDDS was assessed by the dialysis
bag method. LOV microemulsion was instilled into the dialysis bag, firmly sealed with
clamp, and placed in 500 mL of dissolution medium (phosphate buffer pH 6.8) at 37 °C.
The revolution speed of the paddle was maintained at 100 rpm. At predetermined time
intervals, 5 mL of release medium was collected and the same volume of fresh dissolu-
tion medium was replenished to maintain the sink conditions. Concentration of LOV was
analysed with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. All the studies were conducted in triplicates.
Rheological analysis. – SMEDDS (1 mL) was optimised from the zeta potential andin
vitro release studies, i.e., F22 was subjected to viscosity determination. It was diluted 10
times and 100 times with distilled water and then viscosity was measured using a Brook-
field viscometer (Amkette Analytics Ltd, Mumbai, India) and assessed visually for any
phase separation.
In vivo pharmacodynamic studies
Male Wistar rats (weighing 250± 30 g) were obtained from the Central Animal House
facility of the Rayat Institute of Pharmacy, Railmajra, Punjab, India. Experimental pro-
tocols were approved by IAEC (Institutional Animal Ethics Committee) as per guide-
lines of the Committee for the Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals
(CPCSEA), Government of India. Animals were acclimatized in the animal house and
360

were fed normal diet and water ad libitum. Overnight fasted rats were employed in the
study. 250 mg kg–1 Triton WR 1339 (i-octyl-polyoxyethylene phenol) dissolved in 0.9 %
saline was administered orally to induce hyperlipidemia.
Wistar rats were divided into six groups, each containing six animals. The first group
was kept as normal control. The second group was given lovastatin suspension only. Ani-
mals of the other four groups were subjected to Triton-induced hyperlipidemia; after 3 h,
the third group served as control,i.e., with Triton and no drug, the fourth group was ad-
ministered a placebo formulation of SMEDDS (without drug), fifth group was adminis-
tered LOV suspension (2.5 mg kg
–1) in 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and the
sixth group was given optimised SMEDDS formulation of LOV (F22) with the same dose
as given in fifth group (2.5 mg kg
–1). Blood samples were withdrawn at time zero and
after 24 hours of drug treatment. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 10,000g and
used for biochemical analysis. Samples were analysed for total cholesterol, HDL, LDL
and triglycerides usingin vitro diagnostic kits (Ensure Biotech, India). Briefly, set volu-
mes of sample and standard were mixed with the working reagent separately, followed
by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Absorbance of the developed colour was read spectro-
photometrically for cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride determination. From the values of
total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride, plasma LDL contents were determined (11). Li-
pid profiles were estimated in all groups of rats.
Stability
LOV SMEDDS (F22) was tightly sealed in a vial for storage under different storage
conditions (refrigerated 4 °C/75 % RH), real time (room temperature) storage (30 °C/75 %
RH) and accelerated (40 °C/75 % RH) according to ICH (12) guidelines for one month.
The stability was assessed by analysing the physical appearance, droplet size and drug
content at day 0, 7, 15, 21 and 30.
Statistical analysis
All the results were expressed as mean± SD (n= 3 forin vitrostudies andn = 6 for
in vivostudies). The statistical analysis was performed using Studentst-test and ANOVA
followed by the Tukey test.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An important consideration when formulating a self microemulsifying formulation
is avoidance of drug precipitation upon dilution in gut lumen (in vivo). Therefore the
components used in the system should have high solublisation capacity for the drug (2).
Different oils were screened for LOV solublisation, among which Capryol 90 showed the
highest solubility (32.0 ± 0.2 mg mL
–1) while other oils accommodated approximately
10–20 mg mL–1 of LOV. Hence, Capryol 90 was selected as an oil phase. Amongst vari-
ous surfactants, selection was done on the basis of ease of emulsification and higher
transmittance (8). The results revealed that Cremophore RH40 showed 99 % transmit-
tance and 8 inversions, whereas Labrasol and Span 80 showed 69 % and 64 % transmit-
361

tance and 44 and 81 inversions, respectively. In case of the co-surfactants screened, Trans-
cutol P showed 89 % transmittance and 45 inversions compared to propylene glycol and
ethanol with 87 and 88 % transmittance and 50 and 122 inversions, respectively. Thus
Cremophore RH 40 was selected as the surfactant and Transcutol P as co-surfactant.
The FTIR spectra of pure LOV and formulation F22 are shown in Fig. 1. The spec-
trum of pure LOV showed characteristic peaks at 3541 cm
–1 (alcohol O-H stretching),
3015 cm–1 (olefinic C-H stretching), 2965 cm–1 (methyl C-H asymmetric stretching),
2929 cm–1 (methylene C-H asymmetric stretching), 2866 cm–1 (methyl and methylene
C-H asymmetric stretching), 1725, 1699 cm –1 (lactone and ester carbonyl stretch),
1459 cm–1 (methyl asymmetric bend), 1381 cm–1 (methyl symmetric bend), 1262 cm–1
(lactone C-O-C asymmetric bend), 1220 cm–1 (ester C-O-C asymmetric bend), 1073 cm–1
(lactone C-C symmetric bend), 1055 cm–1 (ester C-O-C symmetric bend), 970 cm–1 (alco-
hol C-OH stretch) and 870 cm–1 (trisubstituted olefinic C-H). From Fig. 1, it was obser-
ved that there were no significant changes in the position of characteristic peaks of the
drug when mixed with oil, surfactant and co-surfactant, which indicated compatibility
of excipients and the drug.
Phase diagrams were constructed to figure out the maximum microemulsion area
with optimisation of the best ratio of surfactant and co-surfactant (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1) and
composition of excipients for developing optimal SMEDDS. The purpose was to arrive
at a composition that contained minimum amount of surfactant and co-surfactant with-
out compromising its globule size and stability (9). From Fig. 2, it was observed that the
mixture of surfactant and co-surfactant in ratio 1:1 showed the maximum microemul-
sion area; therefore this was selected as the optimal ratio.
Composition of all the formulations with different ratios of oil to the optimised ratio
of surfactant and co-surfactant (1:1), with or without drug, is shown in Table I. After
preparation, the formulations were subjected to physicochemical characterisation inclu-
ding droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, viscosity and transmis-
sion electron microscopy.
Droplet size is a crucial factor in self-emulsification performance, because it deter-
mines the rate and extent of drug release as well as drug absorption. It has been repor-
ted that small size of emulsion droplets may lead to more rapid absorption, thereby im-
proving the bioavailability (13). Furthermore, a decrease in the droplet size reflects the
formation of a better packed film of the surfactant at the oil-water interface, thereby sta-
bilising the oil droplets (14). PDI is the ratio of standard deviation to mean droplet size,
which signifies uniformity of droplet size within the formulation. The higher the value
of PDI, the lower is the uniformity of droplet size. Results revealed that formulations
F22 to F28 solubilised the therapeutic dose of LOV, but among these formulations F25
and F26 had droplet size larger than 50 nm as well as higher PDI of 0.37± 0.26 and 0.30±
0.24, respectively. Formulations F27 and F28 had lower PDI of 0.28± 0.28 and 0.26± 0.28
but droplet size larger than 50 nm, while formulations F22, F23 and F24 followed the cri-
teria of microemulsion by having the droplet size lower than 50 nm as well as lower PDI
of 0.15± 0.15, 0.21± 0.20 and 0.26± 0.21, respectively, indicating the uniformity of parti-

ation studies.
It has been reported in the literature that an increase in repulsive forces between
microemulsion droplets prevents their coalescence (14). Zeta potential of the selected

formulations (F22, F23 and F24) when diluted 100 times was found to be –4.56, –15.7 and
–12.3 mV, respectively. As formulation F22 showed the highest zeta potential value, it
was concluded to be more stable since coalescence between microemulsion droplets was
prevented.
The drug content uniformity in the optimised formulations (F22, F23 and F24) was
found in the range of 99.3± 1.3 for F22 to 99.8± 1.0 % for F24, indicating uniform drug
dispersion in formulations.

The emulsification rate is a useful index to appraise emulsification efficiency of a
formulation. It has been suggested that the mechanism of self emulsification involves at-
trition of a fine cloud of small droplets from the surface of large droplets, instead of pro-
gressive reduction in droplet size (15). The selected formulations (F22, F23 and F24) we-
re subjected to assessment of emulsification time. The results divulged that F22 showed

minimum emulsification time of 70± 1 s while F23 and F24 showed 188± 2 and 215± 2s
and therefore F22 was found optimised for further evaluation.
The selected formulations F22, F23, F24 and drug solution were subjected to anin
vitro dissolution study by the dialysis bag method (Fig. 3). The release profiles showed
that the drug release from formulation F22 was higher than from the other formulations
and significantly enhanced compared to the standard drug solution (p< 0.05). Factors
responsible may be the small droplet size, as the smaller droplet size provides more sur-
face area for releasing the drug from the system, thereby, increasing the drug release rate
(14, 15). Also, the oil phase of SMEDDS may act as a carrier molecules which do not dif-
fuse through the barrier but allow drug molecules to get diffused through the membra-
ne of the dialysis bag (16).
When a formulation is infinitely diluted, there is a huge possibility of its phase sepa-
ration, since microemulsions are formed at particular oil, surfactant and water concen-
trations. Therefore rheological determination was performed (15). Viscosity of the opti-
mized SMEDDS (F22) was found to be high (40 mPa s, 22 °C). After, 10 and 100 times di-

lution with distilled water, it was found to be 8 mPa s (22 °C) and 4 mPa s (24 °C),
respectively, with no phase separation, which confirmed the stability of the formulation.
The surface morphology of SMEDDS as well as droplet size were predicted by us-
ing transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 4 shows the average droplet size of the micro-
emulsion dispersed from formulation F22. The droplets were spherical in shape, with a
size smaller than 50 nm, which satisfies the criteria of nano size range required for mi-
croemulsifying formulations (17).
The anti-hyperlipidemic activity of LOV-loaded SMEDDS and the active pharma-
ceutical ingredient were evaluated by lipid lowering studies using a Triton-induced hy-
perlipidemia model (8, 11). Triton is a nonionic surfactant that induces hyperlipidemia
by inhibiting peripheral lipoprotein lipase enzymes responsible for removal of lipid par-
ticles from the body. The administration of Triton leads to transient elevation of lipid
levels, which reach a peak 18 to 24 hours after administration (phase I) and start to lo-
wer again the following day (phase II). For our present study, this method was used to
evaluate the lipid-lowering activity of the developed formulation. The mechanism by
which LOV exerts its antihyperlipidemic effect was reported stating thatb-hydroxyacid,
the active metabolite of LOV, lowers plasma lipids by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase,
the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion
of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol.
LOV is known to stay shorter in the blood circulation because it has a biological half-life
of 1.1–1.7 hours. Thus, the effects of LOV and its formulation on serum lipid level were
studied only in phase I.
From the results of pharmacodynamic studies (Fig. 5), it was observed that LOV
suspension produced a drop in serum cholesterol (from 146 to 105 mg per 100 mL), tri-

glyceride (from 248 to 145 mg per 100 mL), LDL (from 171 to 133 mg per 100 mL) and
rise in HDL (from 15 to 26 mg per 100 mL), whereas LOV-loaded SMEDDS formulation
produced a significant decrease in serum cholesterol (from 146 to 51 mg per 100 mL), tri-
glycerides (from 248 to 117 mg per 100 mL), LDL level (from 171 to 22 mg per 100 mL)
and a marked increase in HDL level (from 15 to 36 mg per 100 mL). The anti-hyperlipi-
demic activity of SMEDDS of LOV was significantly higher, (p< 0.05) than of LOV. This
higher lipid lowering activity of the SMEDDS formulation can be explained by the fact
that the SMEDDS formulation resulted in complete dissolution of LOV, which could have
increased absorption and thereby led to higher plasma drug concentration (higher bio-
availability). The low bioavailability of LOV suspension is attributed to its poor aqueous
solubility. The above difference in pharmacodynamic activity and the results ofin vitro
dissolution studies suggest that the SMEDDS formulation resulted in higher oral bio-
availability owing to higher solubilisation of LOV from the SMEDDS formulation com-
pared to the active pharmaceutical ingredient (8).
Stability studies of the selected SMEDDS were performed at refrigerated, real time
and accelerated conditions. The results of the study are presented in Table II. Student’s
t-test was used to compare the results of the sample after 7, 15, 21 and 30 days with the
fresh sample. No significant changes in physical appearance, droplet size and drug con-
tent were observed after stability testing in any case. The results revealed the stability of
optimised SMEDDS formulation of LOV.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the poorly water-soluble LOV was formulated into a beneficial
and patient compliant self-microemulsifying system to improve its solubility and bio-
availability. SMEDDS of LOV was prepared and optimized by using parameters such as
droplet size, PDI, zeta potential, in vitro release data. Optimal SMEDDS consisted of
Capryol 90 as the oil phase, Cremophore RH40 as surfactant and Transcutol P as co-sur-
factant. Permutation of all three components,i.e., oil/surfactant/co-surfactant in the ra-
tio 20:40:40, formulates SMEDDS with particle size 42.5 nm, PDI 0.15 and zeta potential
–4.56 mV. This optimised SMEDDS showed goodin vitro release, which is increased by
more than 90 % when compared to pure drug solution. From pharmacodynamic studies,
we concluded that the developed SMEDDS formulation of LOV shows superior lipid lo-
wering activity compared to pure LOV. Thus our studies exemplified the promising use
of the self-microemulsified drug delivery system to dispense lipid-soluble drugs by oral
route.

U svrhu pove}anja topljivosti i bioraspolo`ivosti lovastatina dizajniran je i evalui-
ran samomikroemulzifikacijski sustav za isporuku lijeka (SMEDDS). Uljna faza izabrana
je na temelju studija topljivosti, a surfaktant i kosurfaktant na temelju njihove sposob-
nosti emulzifikacije. Samoemulzifikacijsko podru~je odre|eno je pomo}u ternarnih faz-
nih dijagrama. Kao optimalni sastojci pokazali su se Kapriol 90 (20 %) kao uljna faza,
Cremophore RH40 (40 %) kao surfaktant i Transcutol P (40 %) kao kosurfaktant. Priprav-
ljenom SMEDDS odre|ena je veli~ina kapljica, zeta potencijal, emulzifikacijsko vrijeme,
reolo{ka svojstva i transmisija u elektronskoj mikroskopiji.In vitro se iz optimiziranog
pripravka oslobodilo 94 % ljekovite tvari, {to je bilo zna~ajno vi{e nego iz otopine lijeka.
Studije in vivona Wistar {takorima kojima je hiperlipidemija inducirana Tritonom poka-
zale su da SMEDDS zna~ajno vi{e sni`ava razinu lipida nego ~isti lovastatin. Istra`iva-
nja su potvrdila da je lovastatin SMEDDS pripravak pogodan za peroralnu primjenu.
