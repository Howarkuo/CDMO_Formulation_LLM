=== ANALYSIS FOR PMC12387411 (PMID: 26754018) ===

SUMMARY:
This study developed a novel Pickering emulsion system for fucoxanthin, a natural carotenoid, to enhance its stability and encapsulation. Utilizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) derived from industrial brown algae waste via high-pressure homogenization, the research demonstrated that homogenization parameters significantly influence CNF properties like polymerization degree, crystallinity, particle size, and Zeta potential. The optimized formulation, a 1.0 mg/mL fucoxanthin emulsion stabilized by CNFs, exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (70.84%) and superior stability against various environmental stressors including pH changes, salinity, temperature fluctuations (up to 85°C), UV irradiation, and storage conditions. The CNF interfacial barrier effectively protected fucoxanthin, maintaining its antioxidant activity. This work advances sustainable marine delivery platforms for nutraceuticals and functional foods, with future plans for cytotoxicity and biocompatibility assessments to support pharmaceutical applications.

Q: 16. What are the potential production feasibility risks associated with the multi-step cellulose isolation and CNF preparation process for large-scale pharmaceutical applications?
A & Reasoning: The multi-step cellulose isolation process, involving methanol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid treatments, extensive washing, t-butanol rinsing, and freeze-drying, followed by high-pressure homogenization (10 passes), presents significant production feasibility risks for large-scale pharmaceutical applications. Reasoning: This process is complex, resource-intensive, and potentially costly due to the use of multiple chemicals, organic solvents, and energy-intensive steps like freeze-drying and repeated high-pressure homogenization. Scaling up such a process would require substantial investment in specialized equipment, waste management, and process optimization to ensure economic viability and environmental sustainability, which are critical considerations for pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Source Paragraph: First, brown seaweed was isolated from brown seaweed industrial waste residue using a previously reported procedure [ 18 ]. Briefly, the industrial waste residue of brown seaweed powder was treated with methanol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, and hydro-chloric acid to remove the nontarget components. Then the mixture was washed in deionized water until pH 7.0 to obtain cellulose. The wet sample was then rinsed with t-butanol, freeze-dried, and stored in a desiccator for structural analysis and enzymatic hydrolysis experiments. The CNFs were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. Briefly, the cellulose isolated from brown seaweed was diluted into 50 mg/mL with deionized water (pH 7.0). Then the cellulose was 35, 70, 105, and 140 MPa homogenized by a high-pressure homogenizer (AH-BASIC, GEA Niro Soavi, Parma, Italy) 10 times. The final CNFs were stored at 4 °C for study.

Q: 17. What critical process parameters (CPPs) related to CNF preparation may pose QA/QC feasibility challenges during scale-up, and how can they be addressed?
A & Reasoning: The polymerization degree, crystallinity index, particle size, and Zeta potential of CNFs are highly dependent on homogenization pressure and number of passes, making these critical process parameters (CPPs) that pose QA/QC feasibility challenges during scale-up. Reasoning: Maintaining consistent CNF quality (e.g., specific polymerization degree, crystallinity, particle size distribution, and surface charge) is crucial for reproducible emulsion performance. Variations in homogenization pressure, flow rate, and the number of passes, especially with natural raw materials, can lead to batch-to-batch inconsistencies. To address this, robust in-process controls and real-time monitoring of homogenization parameters (pressure, flow rate, temperature, number of passes) must be established. Additionally, comprehensive raw material specifications for the seaweed residue are needed to ensure consistent starting material properties, thereby minimizing variability in the final CNF product.
Source Paragraph: The polymerization degree denotes the number of glucose units that were connected in the molecular chain of cellulose. The polymerization degree reflects on the length of the chain of cellulose and significantly affects the physicochemical characteristics of the CNFs. As shown in Table 1 , the homogenization pressure significantly affects the polymerization degree of CNFs. The polymerization degree of CNFs without high-pressure homogenization (H-0) was 331.24 ± 3.6, which is significatively ( p < 0.05) higher than that of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, 170.82 ± 4.1). The polymerization degree of CNFs in the present study was lower than that of cellulose of Kjellmaniella crassifolia (444.60) [ 18 ]. With the increasing pressure of homogenization from 35 to 140 MPa, the low polymerization degree of CNFs could be observed in the results. The CNFs with 140 MPa homogenization (H-140) showed the lowest polymerization degree of 264.94 ± 18.5. The high shear and impact forces of high-pressure homogenization might contribute to such results, cutting the carbohydrate chain of cellulose into shorter CNFs [ 19 ]. The results of the polymerization degree might suggest the effect on the particle size of CNFs and attribute it to the interface stability in Pickering emulsion. Cellulose crystallinity critically affects the suspension stability, Pickering emulsification performance, and thermal stability of emulsions. The microcrystalline cellulose, derived from natural cellulose by the hydrolysis with strong acids to remove a portion of the amorphous regions, exhibits a high degree of crystallinity, with a crystallinity index of 74.96 ± 0.74% as indicated in Table 1 . As shown in Figure 1 B, the presence of crystalline peaks at 22° and weaker peaks around 14° and 16° suggests that cellulose samples exhibit a typical cellulose I structure [ 20 ]. Moreover, both crystalline and amorphous domains could be observed in the X-RD profiles of present samples. The results indicated that shear and impact forces of high-pressure homogenization could not change the crystal type of cellulose [ 21 ]. In addition, the crystallinity index of the cellulose sample is shown in Table 1 . The crystallinity index values of homogenized samples were lower than those of Microcrystalline Cellulose (74.96 ± 0.74) and untreated cellulose (65.23 ± 2.96). The shearing and impacting forces of high-pressure homogenization as described in Figure 1 B might support such reduced crystallinity index values. With the increasing pressure of homogenization, cellulose treated at a homogenization pressure of 105 MPa exhibited a lower crystallinity index than cellulose treated at 140 MPa. The results might indicate the breaking of hydrogen bonds between cellulose molecules and be attributed to the collapse of some crystalline structure [ 22 , 23 ].

Q: 18. What are the stability risks for the fucoxanthin Pickering emulsion during industrial processing and long-term storage, and what solutions are proposed?
A & Reasoning: The fucoxanthin Pickering emulsion's stability is significantly impacted by pH, temperature, and storage time, with encapsulation efficiency decreasing with increasing pH, temperature (from 25°C to 85°C), and over 12 days of storage at both 4°C and 25°C. Reasoning: This sensitivity to environmental factors poses a risk to maintaining product quality during large-scale manufacturing, distribution, and extended shelf-life requirements for pharmaceutical applications. To mitigate these risks, strict control over pH and temperature throughout the manufacturing process and storage is essential. For pharmaceutical applications, comprehensive long-term stability studies under ICH-recommended conditions are required to fully characterize degradation kinetics and establish appropriate shelf-life and storage conditions. Additionally, exploring further protective measures like optimized packaging or the inclusion of pharmaceutical-grade antioxidants could enhance stability.
Source Paragraph: Processing and storage factors, such as pH value, salinity, temperature, UV light exposure duration, and storage time, markedly impact the stability and biological activity of emulsion [ 40 , 41 ]. The surface charge of solid particles and the degree of ionization of functional groups could be controlled by the pH value and impact the stability of the emulsion [ 42 ]. As shown in Figure 6 A, with the increasing pH value, the encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin significantly decreased ( p < 0.05). At pH 3.0 and 5.0, the encapsulation efficiencies of fucoxanthin were 70.48 ± 2.62% and 67.70 ± 3.44%, respectively. In the study of the pH stability of astaxanthin emulsions, the encapsulation efficiency of the astaxanthin emulsion was only 55.36% at pH 5.0 [ 43 ], which was significantly lower than that of the fucoxanthin emulsion. The results confirmed that acidic conditions offered high stability of the fucoxanthin emulsion. Furthermore, the CNFs with high-pressure homogenization showed the potential capability to preserve fucoxanthin upon the water–oil interface in an acidic Pickering emulsion. Thermal processing is widely used in food production and applications. However, high temperature weakens the stability of the Pickering emulsion. For the Pickering emulsions’ encapsulated thermolabile active compounds, strict temperature is essential for thermal processing. The effects of temperature on the encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin emulsion were measured. As shown in Figure 6 C, with the increasing temperature from 25 °C to 85 °C, the encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin in Pickering emulsion was obviously decreased. Although the encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin was 60.49 ± 2.80% at 85 °C, which was significantly lower than that at 25 °C (71.51 ± 2.32%), the 85 °C value still maintained a high encapsulation efficiency. H. Park [ 46 ] reported similar emulsion stabilized by protein-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres with denoted 60.66% encapsulation efficiency at 45 °C. The thermal insulation provided by the CNF barrier at the oil–water interface potentially stems from such high encapsulation efficiency and protecting the bioactivity of the fucoxanthin [ 47 ]. Fucoxanthin is susceptible to temperature and storage time, limiting the application of Pickering emulsion in food. For evaluating the stability of fucoxanthin emulsion, the present Pickering emulsions were stored at 4 °C and 25 °C for 12 days. The encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin was assessed at regular intervals ( Figure 6 E). The results indicated that the encapsulation efficiency of fucoxanthin declined in both 4 °C and 25 °C Pickering emulsion during the 12 days of storage. The encapsulation efficiencies of fucoxanthin in Pickering emulsion kept at 4 °C and 25 °C were 51.63 ± 2.43% and 44.79 ± 1.58%, respectively. The Brownian motion among droplets during storage was possibly consequent upon such results, enlarging droplet size and diminishing with aggregation post-collision [ 50 ]. In addition, the coconut oil in the Pickering emulsion may solidify between 14 °C and 25 °C [ 51 ], thereby strengthening the stability of the Pickering emulsion. Moreover, the solidified coconut oil in the Pickering emulsion might supply a higher retention rate of fucoxanthin when stored at 4 °C compared with 25 °C. Furthermore, such results might suggest that low-temperature storage of the Pickering emulsion can retard the degradation of fucoxanthin, benefitting the bioactivity of fucoxanthin in the delivery system of marine drugs.

Q: 19. What are the excipient applicability risks for pharmaceutical use, given the raw material sourcing and grade of reagents used in the study?
A & Reasoning: The study's reliance on "industrial waste residue of brown seaweed" for cellulose, "analytical grade" fucoxanthin and other reagents, and "food grade" coconut oil presents significant excipient applicability risks for pharmaceutical use. Reasoning: Pharmaceutical products require all excipients to meet stringent pharmacopeial standards (e.g., USP, EP) and be sourced from qualified suppliers with comprehensive regulatory documentation. Industrial waste residue, while sustainable, may lack consistent purity, have variable contaminant profiles, and face regulatory hurdles for drug product inclusion. Similarly, "analytical grade" reagents are not suitable for pharmaceutical manufacturing due to insufficient quality control and documentation. A solution involves identifying and qualifying pharmaceutical-grade suppliers for all components, developing robust specifications for the seaweed cellulose (including limits for heavy metals, microbial contaminants, and residual solvents), and ensuring all materials comply with cGMP requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Source Paragraph: The raw material used in this study was the discarded residue from the extraction of alginate, provided by Qingdao Mingyue Group (Qingdao, China). The glucan content in the industrial waste residue of brown seaweed was 94.52 ± 7.90%, the ash content was 2.63 ± 0.53%, and the moisture content was 90.06 ± 0.07%. The fucoxanthin (analytical grade) was purchased from Qingdao Mingyue Group (Qingdao, China). The coconut oil (food grade) was purchased from Wenchang Dongjiao Coconut Processing Professional Cooperative (Hainan, China). The anhydrous ethanol, glacial acetic acid, tertiary butanol, potassium persulfate, copper ethylenediamine solution, calcium carbonate potassium bromide sodium chlorite, sodium chloride, glucose, and sodium hydroxide were all analytical grade and were purchased from Macklin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) used in the present study were all analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. (Alexandria, VA, USA). The glucose determination kit was purchased from Abcam Co., Ltd. (ab65333, Shanghai, China). The concentrated sulfuric acid was analytical grade and was also purchased from Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).

Q: 20. What is a critical risk factor for the pharmaceutical application of this fucoxanthin delivery system, and what is the proposed solution?
A & Reasoning: A critical risk factor for the pharmaceutical application of this fucoxanthin delivery system is the explicit lack of completed cytotoxicity and biocompatibility assessments, which are stated as "future" or "planned" work. Reasoning: For any pharmaceutical product, comprehensive in vitro and in vivo safety data, including toxicology and biocompatibility, are absolutely fundamental for regulatory approval and patient safety. Without these assessments, the suitability of seaweed CNFs as a pharmaceutical excipient and the overall safety profile of the fucoxanthin Pickering emulsion as a drug delivery system cannot be established. The proposed solution is to prioritize and execute a comprehensive battery of toxicology, biocompatibility, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies for both the CNFs and the final fucoxanthin Pickering emulsion to demonstrate safety and efficacy required for pharmaceutical development and regulatory submission.
Source Paragraph: In the future, cytotoxicity and biocompatibility assessments will be performed or planned to support pharmaceutical applications in the next study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the fucoxanthin delivery system of Pickering emulsion stabilized by CNFs. This research advances sustainable marine delivery platforms for nutraceuticals and fortified foods, bridging the gap between laboratory innovation and practical application. This study has certain limitations. The correlation between the structure and interface properties of the CNFs in Pickering emulsions was not extensively explored. These factors are crucial for industrial applications. In addition, further discussion on industrial implications is needed, especially regarding compatibility with processing equipment and scalability of the emulsion preparation process. The future study will involve collaboration with seaweed processing industries to conduct a comprehensive industrial analysis, ensuring the developed emulsions can be effectively translated into large-scale production. Moreover, cytotoxicity and biocompatibility assessments will be performed or planned to support pharmaceutical applications in the next study.
