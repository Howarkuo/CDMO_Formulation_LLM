    "brief_summary": "This study developed and optimized a stable topical Erlotinib (ERL) cream formulation for treating rare skin diseases, addressing the challenges of formulating ERL from tablets. Key findings include the superior extraction efficiency of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) over Transcutol, achieving 100% ERL recovery. The formulation's stability was significantly improved by using 5% (v/w) DMSO, adjusting the pH to neutral (~7.0), and incorporating an antioxidant-rich cream base (Nourivan Antiox). The optimized 0.2% ERL cream demonstrated homogeneity and stability for at least 42 days at room temperature, with no detectable degradation products, making it suitable for potential clinical trials for localized skin disorders.",
