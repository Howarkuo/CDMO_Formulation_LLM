    "brief_summary": "This study investigated spray-drying and freeze-drying techniques to convert solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) suspensions into dry powders, aiming to overcome physical and chemical instability during storage. Both methods successfully produced SLN dry powders suitable for pharmaceutical applications, albeit with varying yields. Freeze-drying, under optimized conditions, yielded a dry powder with excellent reconstitution properties and maintained technological parameters similar to the initial suspension. Glucose, particularly at an optimal concentration of 1% w/v, was identified as the most effective cryoprotectant in preventing particle growth during the freeze-drying process. While spray-drying led to macroaggregate formation and increased particle size, ultrasonication proved to be the most effective reconstitution method for freeze-dried SLNs, restoring their original thermotropic behavior.",
