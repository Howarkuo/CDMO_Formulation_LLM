=== Part1 ANALYSIS ===
SUMMARY:
This study focused on preparing and assessing the kinetic stability of an injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion. The emulsion featured cationic droplets stabilized by a poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier film, eliminating the need for phospholipid emulgators. Key findings revealed that cryoprotectants (5% sucrose + 5% sorbitol) significantly improved the emulsion's stability against droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. Over a 6-month storage period, the mean diameter of dispersed oil droplets remained stable at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C. However, the emulsion stored at 37°C showed a progressive decrease in pH and zeta potential values, attributed to the formation of free fatty acids from castor oil. This stable, phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion holds promise as a versatile drug delivery vehicle for various active pharmaceutical ingredients, from small molecules to macromolecules.

Q: 1. What were the primary objectives of the present work regarding the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion?
A: The primary objectives were to prepare a castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and to assess its kinetic stability after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze–thaw cycling.
Source: The objectives of the present work were to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm and to assess the kinetic stability of the prepared cationic emulsion after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze– thaw cycling. Presence of cryoprotectants (5%,w/w, sucrose +5%, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C over a period of up to 6 months, no signiﬁcant change was noted in mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did not. This indicates that at 37°C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values. Thus, the injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion could be useful for incorporating various active pharmaceutical ingredients that are in size from small molecular drugs to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.

Q: 2. How did cryoprotectants influence the stability of the emulsions during freeze-thaw cycling?
A: The presence of cryoprotectants (5%, w/w, sucrose + 5%, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling.

Q: 4. What is an oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion defined as?
A: An oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion is a heterogeneous dispersion of two immiscible liquids.
Source: An oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion is a heterogeneous dispersion of two immiscible liquids. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the o/w nano-sized emulsion is subjected to various instability processes like aggregation, ﬂocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and hence eventual phase separation (1,2). Unlike microemulsions which are thermodynamically stable and clear transparent liquid system, macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions are meta-stable dispersions. However, the stability of the o/w macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions can substantially be improved with the help of suitable emulsiﬁers or emulgators that are capable of forming a mono- or multilayer coating ﬁlm around the dispersed oil droplets in order to reduce interfacial tension and to increase droplet– droplet repulsion (3). Depending on the concentrations of these three components (oil– emulgators– water) and the efﬁciency of the emulsiﬁcation equipments used to reduce droplet size into a nano-sized and/or monodispersed size range, the o/w nano-sized emulsion with improved stability over the desired time span (in comparison to coarse emulsion) can be obtained. The advantages of the nano-sized emulsion system include: natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization either at the innermost oil phase or at the o/w interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability (4). Due to these advantages, the nano-sized emulsion is now recognized as a promising drug delivery vehicle or carrier for parenteral (5) and topical (ocular and percutaneous) (5,6) applications.

------------------------------
Q: 7. What are the typical components and their proportions in an o/w type nano-sized emulsion intended for parenteral and topical applications?
A: The o/w type nano-sized emulsion generally consists of 0.5–20% of oil or oil mixture, 0.1–10% of an emulgator, 0.05–5% of a nonionic surfactant, and permitted amounts of preservatives and osmotic agent, with the remaining proportion being an aqueous component.
Source: In general, the o/w type nano-sized emulsion (meant for parenteral and topical applications) consists of 0.5– 20% of oil or oil mixture, 0.1– 10% of an emulgator, 0.05– 5% of a nonionic surfactant, and permitted amount of preservatives and osmotic agent (5). The remaining proportion comprises an aqueous component. To make anionic o/w nano-sized emulsion, phospholipid-like Lipoid E80 either alone or in combination with a water-soluble nonionic surfactant (poloxamer) and a stabilizer-like oleic acid/cholic acid/deoxycholic acid or its sodium salt was used as emulgator (3). In addition, a cationic o/w nano-sized emulsion was prepared and stabilized by forming a mixed emulgator ﬁlm comprising phospholipids, poloxamer, and stearylamine/oleylamine at the o/w interface of the oil droplets (4,7). Antioxidants such asα-tocopherol was also included in most of the developed nano-sized emulsions in order to prevent the oxidative degradation of phospholipid or other emulsion components and thus the minimization of free fatty acid formation in phospholipid-based emulsions following autoclave sterilization and subsequent storage at stipulated conditions. However, even with the addition of antioxidants, the phospholipid-containing emulsion was prone to the liberation of free fatty acids (from phospholipid components), leading to the generation microclimate acidic pH in the vicinity of the oil phase, oil– water interface, and water phase of the emulsion (8,9). The microclimate pH thus generated might be harmful to the emulsion-incorporated drug mole-cules. Up to now, the adjustment of pH of the sterilized emulsion by adding mild alkali is the only viable option to prepare the emulsion with desired near neutral value (pH ≈7). If free fatty acid was released or mild alkali solution was added during the formulation of phospholipid-stabilized emulsion, then incorporation of peptide or protein into the emulsion might be questionable due to its possible structural degradation/modiﬁcation. In this context, it becomes necessary to develop an emulsion without the addition of phospholipid emulgator but still shows the required kinetic stability for at least over months. Therefore, castor oil, poloxamer– chitosan, and water are being selected respectively as the model oil– emulgators– water components to prepare the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 8. Why was it considered necessary to develop an emulsion without the addition of a phospholipid emulgator?
A: It was necessary because phospholipid-containing emulsions, even with antioxidants, were prone to liberating free fatty acids, creating microclimate acidic pH that could be harmful to incorporated drug molecules like peptides or proteins due to possible structural degradation.

The remaining proportion comprises an aqueous component. To make anionic o/w nano-sized emulsion, phospholipid-like Lipoid E80 either alone or in combination with a water-soluble nonionic surfactant (poloxamer) and a stabilizer-like oleic acid/cholic acid/deoxycholic acid or its sodium salt was used as emulgator (3).

Q: 9. Which components were selected as the model oil, emulgators, and water for preparing the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion?
A: Castor oil was selected as the model oil, poloxamer–chitosan as emulgators, and water as the water component.

Q: 10. What were the main materials used for the preparation of the nano-sized emulsion, and from where were they obtained?
A: Castor oil and α-tocopherol were purchased from Fluka; Chitosan was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co.; Poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F68) was furnished by BASF.
Source: Castor oil andα-tocopherol were purchased from Fluka (St. Louis, MO, USA). Chitosan (medium molecular weight; deacetylation, 81%; viscosity of 1 wt.% solution in 1 wt.% acetic acid, 286 cps; moisture, 4.6 wt.%; ash, 0.5 wt.%) was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Polyoxyethylene– poloxypropylene emulsiﬁer, poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F68), was furnished by BASF (Parsippany, NJ, USA). All other chemicals were obtained commercially and used as received.
------------------------------
Q: 11. Describe the initial heating and mixing steps involved in preparing the nano-sized emulsion.
A: 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml of α-tocopherol were heated to 70°C; 250 mg of chitosan in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid was heated to 70°C; 500 mg of poloxamer 188 in 50 ml double distilled water with 1.125 g glycerin was heated to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution, then poloxamer–glycerin solution was added and stirred.
Source: The phospholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion was prepared according to the method described elsewhere [6]. In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα-tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C. Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer. The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of 85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica, Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below 20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer, APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in.2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then ﬁltered through a TE membrane ﬁlter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany) with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. In total, nine replicate emulsion samples were prepared using the same ingredients with identical experimental conditions.
------------------------------
Q: 12. How was the prepared emulsion sterilized?
A: The emulsion was sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min after being packed under a nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles.

------------------------------
Q: 13. What was the mean droplet diameter range and initial zeta potential of the freshly prepared o/w nano-sized emulsion?
A: The mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218–250 nm, and the initial zeta potential was about +41.4 mV.
Source: Table I shows mean droplet diameter of the o/w nano-sized emulsion. The mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218– 250 nm and presented a monodispersed droplet size distribution. As expected, the zeta potential of the developed emulsion was also in positive unit due to the presence of cationic polysaccharide (chitosan) at the mixed emulgator ﬁlm. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. In addition, the viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion formulation was measured and found to be 1.5 cps.

Q: 14. What combination of forces was responsible for the stabilization of the dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion?

Q: 15. What was the observed change in mean droplet diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion after storage up to 6 months at various temperatures?
A: Up to 37°C, no significant changes were noted in the mean droplet diameter, indicating the emulsion remained physically stable over the 6-month period.
Source: The effect of storage temperature and time on the droplet mean diameter and zeta potential values of castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion was followed up to 6 months’ storage time at three differ ent temperature conditions (Table I). It should be emphasized that in total, nine independent emulsion samples were used to perform the stability assessment. Up to 37°C, no signiﬁcant changes were noted in mean droplet diameter. This indicates that over this 6-month period, castor oil- based nano-sized emulsion remained physically stable. However, depending on the storage temperatures, the zeta potential of the emulsion was found to decrease. Immediately after the preparation of fresh emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV (Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization at elevated temperature. Keeping the emulsion at 37°C for up to 6 months decreased the zeta potential to +30.6±1.37 mV. The same emulsion stored at 25°C showed a lesser reduction in the zeta potential (+37.2±2.35 mV). At 4°C, the zeta potential of the emulsion was still found to be +37.8±0.89 mV. Statistical analysis of these data revealed signiﬁcant differ-ences (p<0.05; Table I). From this result, it appears that the lowest temperature was more adequate for castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion storage in terms of the emulsi ﬁed particle’s surface charge. It should be emphasized that an excessive shaking (100 strokes/minutes over 24 h) of the emulsion was performed following the completion of the storage conditions in order to verify the inﬂuence of the storage conditions and mechanical stress on the droplet diameter. No change in the mean droplet diameter was observed, indicating the lack of any inﬂuence before and after shaking of the emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 16. How did the zeta potential of the emulsion change after 6 months of storage at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C?
A: After 6 months, the zeta potential decreased to +37.8±0.89 mV at 4°C, +37.2±2.35 mV at 25°C, and +30.6±1.37 mV at 37°C.

Q: 17. Describe the changes in pH of the emulsion when stored at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C.
A: A progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) was noticed when stored at 37°C. At 25°C, reduction also occurred. At 4°C, the initial reduction started only after 2 months, and pH decreased by only one unit over 6 months, slower than at higher temperatures.
Source: The change in pH of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion with time as a function of storage temperature is depicted in Fig.1. The ﬁgure clearly shows the reduction of the emulsion’s pH at 25°C and 37°C. It should be noted that the initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0 using a mild acid before subjecting the emulsion to sterilization. However, a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) of the emulsion was noticed when stored at 37°C. The higher is the storage temperature, the more is the liberation of free fatty acid from castor oil, resulting in the auto-alteration of the emulsion’s pH. At 4°C, it is interesting to see that the initial reduction of pH started only after 2 months, and even after its initiation, the progression in the reduction of pH was also not so rapid in the following months as compared to the higher storage temperatures. Thus, pH decreased only by one single unit.
------------------------------
Q: 18. What are the physicochemical mechanisms responsible for extensive droplet aggregation during freeze-thaw cycling in the absence of cryoprotectants?
A: Mechanisms include water crystallization causing oil droplets to come into closer proximity, increased ionic strength in the non-frozen aqueous phase, ice crystals penetrating and disrupting interfacial membranes, and fat crystallization in droplets promoting partial coalescence.
Source: Preliminary experiments indicated that the emulsion was unstable for freeze– thaw cycling in the absence of cryoprotectants. Dependence of mean particle diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion on the number of freeze– thaw cycles (−10°C for 22 h/30°C for 2 h) in the absence and presence of cryoprotectants is depicted in Fig. 2. In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the emulsion was found to increase progressively from 243 to 480 nm after ﬁve cycles. A number of physicochemical mechanisms may be responsible for the extensive droplet aggregation observed in the absence of cryoprotectants. First, when the emulsion was placed in the freezer, some of its water crystallized. This caused the dispersed oil droplets to come into closer proximity because the oil droplets were conﬁned to the nonfrozen regions remaining in the aqueous phase (16). When there was no presence of sufﬁcient free water to fully hydrate the oil droplet surfaces (17– 19), the droplet– droplet interactions was forced closer together to effect coalescence to occur. Second, ice crystallization led to an increase in the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated non-frozen aqueous phase surrounding the emulsion droplets (18). Third, it is possible that ice crystals formed during freezing may have penetrated into the oil droplets and disrupted their interfacial membranes. This allowed the oil droplets more prone to coalescence between them. Fourth, cooling may have caused some of the fat in the emulsion droplets to crystallize promoting partial coalescence due to penetration of a fat crystal from one droplet through the membrane of another droplet (20,21).
------------------------------
Q: 19. How effective were cryoprotectants (5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol) in maintaining the mean droplet diameter during freeze-thaw cycling?
A: The cryoprotectants improved stability significantly; after one cycle, there was no significant change (around 240 nm), and after five cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased only to 260 nm.
Source: In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm), and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased to 260 nm only.

Q: 20. What are the proposed mechanisms by which cryoprotectants improve emulsion stability during freeze-thaw cycling?
A: Cryoprotectants increase osmolyte concentration in the aqueous phase, reducing crystallization temperature and increasing non-frozen aqueous phase volume, and they form hydrogen bonds with emulsifiers on droplet surfaces, reducing interactions when free water content is reduced.
Source: A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the ability of cryoprotectants to improve the stability of emulsions to aggregation during freeze – thaw cycling. First, cryoprotectants increased the osmolyte concentra-tion in the aqueous phase, thereby reducing its crystal-lization temperature. Subsequently, the total amount of ice crystal formation was limited, and therefore, the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets was increased (18). Second, cryoprotectants formed hydrogen bonds with emulsiﬁers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency for interactions to occur between droplet surfaces when the free water content was reduced by ice crystallization (19).
