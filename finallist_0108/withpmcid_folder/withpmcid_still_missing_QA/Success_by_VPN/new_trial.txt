Abstract. The objectives of the present work were to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion
containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm and to assess the kinetic
stability of the prepared cationic emulsion after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze– thaw
cycling. Presence of cryoprotectants (5%,w/w, sucrose +5%, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of
emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4°C, 25°C,
and 37°C over a period of up to 6 months, no signiﬁcant change was noted in mean diameter of the
dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive
decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did
not. This indicates that at 37°C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the
liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values.
Thus, the injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion could be useful for incorporating various active
pharmaceutical ingredients that are in size from small molecular drugs to large macromolecules such as
oligonucleotides.

INTRODUCTION
An oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion is a hetero-
genous dispersion of two immiscible liquids. According to the
second law of thermodynamics, the o/w nano-sized emulsion
is subjected to various instability processes like aggregation,
ﬂocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and hence even-
tual phase separation (1,2). Unlike microemulsions which are
thermodynamically stable and clear transparent liquid system,
macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions are meta-stable
dispersions. However, the stability of the o/w macro (coarse)-
and nano-sized emulsions can substantially be improved with
the help of suitable emulsiﬁers or emulgators that are capable
of forming a mono- or multilayer coating ﬁlm around the
dispersed oil droplets in order to reduce interfacial tension and
to increase droplet– droplet repulsion (3). Depending on the
concentrations of these three components (oil– emulgators–
water) and the efﬁciency of the emulsiﬁcation equipments used
to reduce droplet size into a nano-sized and/or monodispersed
size range, the o/w nano-sized emulsion with improved stability
over the desired time span (in comparison to coarse emulsion)
can be obtained. The advantages of the nano-sized emulsion
system include: natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer
droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization
either at the innermost oil phase or at the o/w interface,
minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability (4). Due
to these advantages, the nano-sized emulsion is now recognized
as a promising drug delivery vehicle or carrier for parenteral (5)
and topical (ocular and percutaneous) (5,6) applications.
In general, the o/w type nano-sized emulsion (meant for
parenteral and topical applications) consists of 0.5– 20% of oil
or oil mixture, 0.1– 10% of an emulgator, 0.05– 5% of a nonionic
surfactant, and permitted amount of preservatives and osmotic
agent (5). The remaining proportion comprises an aqueous
component. To make anionic o/w nano-sized emulsion,
phospholipid-like Lipoid E80 either alone or in combination
with a water-soluble nonionic surfactant (poloxamer) and a
stabilizer-like oleic acid/cholic acid/deoxycholic acid or its
sodium salt was used as emulgator (3). In addition, a cationic
o/w nano-sized emulsion was prepared and stabilized by
forming a mixed emulgator ﬁlm comprising phospholipids,
poloxamer, and stearylamine/oleylamine at the o/w interface of
the oil droplets (4,7). Antioxidants such asα-tocopherol was
also included in most of the developed nano-sized emulsions in
order to prevent the oxidative degradation of phospholipid or
other emulsion components and thus the minimization of free
fatty acid formation in phospholipid-based emulsions following
autoclave sterilization and subsequent storage at stipulated
conditions. However, even with the addition of antioxidants,

the phospholipid-containing emulsion was prone to the
liberation of free fatty acids (from phospholipid components),
leading to the generation microclimate acidic pH in the
vicinity of the oil phase, oil– water interface, and water phase
of the emulsion (8,9). The microclimate pH thus generated
might be harmful to the emulsion-incorporated drug mole-
cules. Up to now, the adjustment of pH of the sterilized
emulsion by adding mild alkali is the only viable option to
prepare the emulsion with desired near neutral value
(pH ≈7). If free fatty acid was released or mild alkali
solution was added during the formulation of phospholipid-
stabilized emulsion, then incorporation of peptide or protein
into the emulsion might be questionable due to its possible
structural degradation/modi ﬁcation. In this context, it
becomes necessary to develop an emulsion without the
addition of phospholipid emulgator but still shows the
required kinetic stability for at least over months. Therefore,
castor oil, poloxamer– chitosan, and water are being selected
respectively as the model oil– emulgators– water components
to prepare the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion.
The objectives of the present work were to prepare
castor oil-based nano-sized e mulsion containing cationic
droplets stabilized by poloxamer – chitosan emulgator ﬁlm
and to assess the kinetic stability of the prepared cationic
emulsion after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze–
thaw cycling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Castor oil andα-tocopherol were purchased from Fluka
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Chitosan (medium molecular weight;
deacetylation, 81%; viscosity of 1 wt.% solution in 1 wt.%
acetic acid, 286 cps; moisture, 4.6 wt.%; ash, 0.5 wt.%) was
obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Polyoxyethylene– poloxypropylene emulsiﬁer, poloxamer 188
(Pluronic F68), was furnished by BASF (Parsippany, NJ, USA).
All other chemicals were obtained commercially and used as
received.
Methods
Preparation of Nano-sized Emulsion
The phospholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized
emulsion was prepared according to the method described
elsewhere [6]. In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα-
tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C.
Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in
5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five
hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml
double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a
separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added
to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution
was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer.
The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of
85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was
further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica,
Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below
20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a
two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer,
APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in.
2 for
5 min. The emulsion was then ﬁltered through a TE
membrane ﬁlter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany)
with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under
nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then
sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. In total,
nine replicate emulsion samples were prepared using the
same ingredients with identical experimental conditions.
Zeta Potential, pH, and Viscosity Measurements
The zeta potential measurements were carried out using
the Malvern Zetasizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments, Ltd.,
Malvern, UK). The samples were diluted in double distilled
water and the measurements carried out in 10 mM NaCl
solution. Each sample was analyzed twice, each analysis
consisting of three replicates.
The pH was recorded at given time intervals using a pH
meter under different storage temperatures (MP220 pH
meter, Mettler Toledo, UK).
An Ubbelohde capillary viscometer (Schott, Hofheim,
Germany) was used to measure the viscosity of the emulsion
samples stored at three different storage temperatures over
time.
Particle Size Analysis
Mean droplet diameter was determined utilizing an ALV
Noninvasive Back Scattering High Performance Particle Sizer
(ALV-NIBS HPPS; Langen, Germany) at 25°C and using
water (refractive index, 1.332; viscosity, 0.894543) as the
dilution medium. A laser beam at 632-nm wavelength was
used. The sensitivity range was 0.5 nm– 5 mm. Apart from the
freshly prepared emulsion, the emulsions stored at 4±2°C, 25±
2°C and 37±2°C over up to 6 months were also followed up to
notice the change in mean droplet diameters. Values reported
were the mean droplet diameter of triplicate emulsion samples
stored at three different storage temperatures.
Stability Assessment
The pH, zeta potential, and droplet mean diameter were
monitored over up to 6 months’ time in the emulsions stored
at 4±2°C, 25±2°C, and 37±2°C. Three independent emulsion
samples for each storage conditions (3×3=9 emulsions) were
used. Possible phase separations were also assessed visually at
given time intervals. All other visible changes were recorded.
Accelerated Stability Test
Since sterilization for 15 min is a drastic operation, it
constitutes an accelerated stability test by itself. Creaming
and phase separation were then assessed visually after
sterilization. To evaluate the mechanical and physical resist-
ance, the emulsion should be subjected to an accelerated
mechanical stress. For this purpose, those emulsion bottles
which were stored at the already stated temperature con-
ditions for up to 6 months’ time were shaken at 100 strokes/
minute by an oscillatory agitation motion over 24 h at 25°C.
905Stability of Castor Oil-Based Nano-sized Emulsion
The droplet size was evaluated before and after this accel-
erated test.
Freeze–Thaw Cycling Stability
The freeze– thaw cycling stability of the emulsion in
presence of cryoprotectants (5%, w/w, sucrose +5%, w/w,
sorbitol) or in the absence of cryoprotectants was tested by
transferring the emulsion sample (5 ml) into plastic test tubes
and subsequently placing it in a−10°C freezer for 16 h and
then thawing in a water bath at 30°C for 2 h. This freeze– thaw
cycle was repeatedﬁve times, and its inﬂuence on emulsion
property (particle mean diameter) was measured after each
cycle.
Statistical Analysis
All the data were subjected to Student’s t test toﬁnd out
the statistical difference. The alpha (α) value for statistical
signiﬁcance is 0.05 (i.e.,p<0.05).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Excipient Selection
In the current investigation, a well-known combined
emulsiﬁcation and homogenization technique was used to
prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion. Without the
addition of any phospholipid emulgator, the o/w nano-sized
emulsion was stabilized with the poloxamer– chitosan emul-
gator ﬁlm. In an arbitrary manner, the amount of castor oil,
poloxamer, and chitosan was chosen and kept respectively at
5 ml, 500 mg, and 250 mg to prepare the nine replicate
emulsion samples. In the medicalﬁeld, most of the nano-sized
emulsion was prepared utilizing the lower viscosity and
digestible oils, derived from the family of triglycerides, like
medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), soybean oil, sesame seed
oil, cottonseed oil, and saf ﬂower oil. In our preliminary
experiments, none of the aforementioned oils is able to
produce a stable emulsion system when poloxamer– chitosan
emulsiﬁer combination is used. Previous literature references
show that using corn oil as the oil phase and lecithin– chitosan
as the emulsiﬁer combination resulted in a stable emulsion
system (10,11). In addition, it was shown previously in the
phospholipid-stabilized emulsion that when using castor oil as
a single oil phase, the ﬁnal emulsion did not show stable
behavior in the long-term stability ( 12). But it was our
experience that in comparison to other oils, castor oil has
higher solubilization capacity to dissolve peptidic molecule
like cyclosporin A (9). Therefore, despite its higher viscosity,
castor oil alone was used in that previous study to prepare the
phospholipid-stabilized emulsion containing cyclosporin A.
Among the different natural and synthetic antioxidant
molecules that have been available (13), α-tocopherol was
the widely used antioxidant to prepare phospholipid-
stabilized nano-sized emulsion (6). The currently developed
(phospholipidless) emulsion was prepared based on castor oil,
stabilized with the poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm, and
incorporated α-tocopherol and osmotic agent.
Particle Size and Emulsion Stabilization
Table I shows mean droplet diameter of the o/w nano-
sized emulsion. The mean droplet diameter was in the range
of 218– 250 nm and presented a monodispersed droplet size
distribution. As expected, the zeta potential of the developed
emulsion was also in positive unit due to the presence of
cationic polysaccharide (chitosan) at the mixed emulgator
ﬁlm. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean
particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that
chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and
intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules.
Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and
electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible
for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the
phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. In addition, the
viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion for-
mulation was measured and found to be 1.5 cps.
Furthermore, the substantial stability shown by phos-
pholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion even
after autoclave sterilization could reasonably be attributed to
the following explanation. Castor oil is known to contain
traces of free fatty acid (recinoleic acid), and even some
amount of fatty acid is likely to be liberated after autoclave

sterilization. After interaction with positively charged chito-
san, the negatively charged fatty acids might acquire mild
emulsiﬁcation property (14). A similar effect of achievement
of emulsion kinetic stability through the same poloxamer–
chitosan emulgatorﬁlm was reported (14,15). However, these
authors used the oil mixture (castor oil and MCT) as an oil
phase of the emulsion rather than single oil (castor oil) alone
to prepare the o/w nano-sized emulsion. In this respect, our
developed emulsion differs signi ﬁcantly from the report
published previously by the other research groups.
Zeta Potential and Storage Conditions
The effect of storage temperature and time on the
droplet mean diameter and zeta potential values of castor
oil-based nano-sized emulsion was followed up to 6 months’
storage time at three differ ent temperature conditions
(Table I). It should be emphasized that in total, nine
independent emulsion samples were used to perform the
stability assessment. Up to 37°C, no signiﬁcant changes were
noted in mean droplet diameter. This indicates that over this
6-month period, castor oil- based nano-sized emulsion
remained physically stable. However, depending on the
storage temperatures, the zeta potential of the emulsion was
found to decrease. Immediately after the preparation of fresh
emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV
(Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was
sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon
random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization
at elevated temperature. Keeping the emulsion at 37°C for up
to 6 months decreased the zeta potential to +30.6±1.37 mV.
The same emulsion stored at 25°C showed a lesser reduction
in the zeta potential (+37.2±2.35 mV). At 4°C, the zeta
potential of the emulsion was still found to be +37.8±0.89 mV.
Statistical analysis of these data revealed signiﬁcant differ-
ences (p<0.05; Table I). From this result, it appears that the
lowest temperature was more adequate for castor oil-based
nano-sized emulsion storage in terms of the emulsi ﬁed
particle’s surface charge. It should be emphasized that an
excessive shaking (100 strokes/minutes over 24 h) of the
emulsion was performed following the completion of
the storage conditions in order to verify the inﬂuence of the
storage conditions and mechanical stress on the droplet
diameter. No change in the mean droplet diameter was
observed, indicating the lack of any inﬂuence before and
after shaking of the emulsion.
Emulsion’s pH and Storage Conditions
The change in pH of the castor oil-based nano-sized
emulsion with time as a function of storage temperature is
depicted in Fig.1. The ﬁgure clearly shows the reduction of
the emulsion’s pH at 25°C and 37°C. It should be noted that
the initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0 using a mild
acid before subjecting the emulsion to sterilization. However,
a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) of the emulsion
was noticed when stored at 37°C. The higher is the storage
temperature, the more is the liberation of free fatty acid
from castor oil, resulting in the auto-alteration of the
emulsion’s pH. At 4°C, it is interesting to see that the
initial reduction of pH started only after 2 months, and even
after its initiation, the progression in the reduction of pH
was also not so rapid in the following months as compared
to the higher storage temperatures. Thus, pH decreased only
by one single unit.
The combined implications of decreasing zeta potential
and pH within the studied storage conditions in the absence
of signi
ﬁcant droplet diameter increase could be explained on
the basis of the mixed poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm
and the observed high positive zeta potential value. Chitosan
has a positive charge in acidic solutions due to the presence of
protonated amino groups along its backbone that have pKa
values between 6.3 and 7.0 (10,11). During emulsiﬁcation,
chitosan molecules are localized at the interface and interca-
lated between the nonionic surfactants. Hence, a mixed
interfacial ﬁlm comprising the poloxamer and chitosan
molecules was formed at the o/w interface which resulted in
an overall positive surface charge (zeta potential). The high
positive zeta potential value observed even after the higher
storage temperatures was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet
coalescence upon random collisions. Moreover, the combined
steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan)

repulsive forces were also operating onto the dispersed castor
oil droplets to maintain the stability of the produced nano-
sized particles. It should be added that the viscosity of the
emulsion stored at three different temperatures did not show
any signiﬁcant change (data not shown). This result further
substantiates the interfacial properties of the chitosan along
with poloxamer. Consequently, no signiﬁcant droplet diameter
increase was noted in the emulsion.
Freeze– Thaw Cycling Stability and Cryoprotectants
Preliminary experiments indicated that the emulsion was
unstable for freeze– thaw cycling in the absence of cryopro-
tectants. Dependence of mean particle diameter of the castor
oil-based nano-sized emulsion on the number of freeze– thaw
cycles (−10°C for 22 h/30°C for 2 h) in the absence and
presence of cryoprotectants is depicted in Fig. 2. In the
absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the
emulsion was found to increase progressively from 243 to
480 nm after ﬁve cycles. A number of physicochemical
mechanisms may be responsible for the extensive droplet
aggregation observed in the absence of cryoprotectants. First,
when the emulsion was placed in the freezer, some of its
water crystallized. This caused the dispersed oil droplets to
come into closer proximity because the oil droplets were
conﬁned to the nonfrozen regions remaining in the aqueous
phase (16). When there was no presence of sufﬁcient free
water to fully hydrate the oil droplet surfaces (17– 19), the
droplet– droplet interactions was forced closer together to
effect coalescence to occur. Second, ice crystallization led to
an increase in the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated
non-frozen aqueous phase surrounding the emulsion droplets
(18). Third, it is possible that ice crystals formed during
freezing may have penetrated into the oil droplets and
disrupted their interfacial membranes. This allowed the oil
droplets more prone to coalescence between them. Fourth,
cooling may have caused some of the fat in the emulsion
droplets to crystallize promoting partial coalescence due to
penetration of a fat crystal from one droplet through the
membrane of another droplet (20,21).
In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved
the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during
freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was
no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the
castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose
and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm),
and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter
increased to 260 nm only.
A number of mechanisms have been proposed to
account for the ability of cryoprotectants to improve the
stability of emulsions to aggregation during freeze – thaw
cycling. First, cryoprotectants increased the osmolyte concen-
tration in the aqueous phase, thereby reducing its crystal-
lization temperature. Subsequently, the total amount of ice
crystal formation was limited, and therefore, the volume of
non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets was
increased (18). Second, cryoprotectants formed hydrogen
bonds with emulsiﬁers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby
reducing the tendency for interactions to occur between
droplet surfaces when the free water content was reduced
by ice crystallization (19).
CONCLUSIONS
The castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion was prepared
following the well-known emulsi ﬁcation–
homogenization
technique. To eliminate the lecithin or phospholipid (anionic)
components, the nonionic– cationic emulgatorﬁlm was used to
stabilize the o/w nano-sized emulsion. Regardless of the
storage conditions, the poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm
was able to stabilize the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion
in terms of mean droplet diameter. However, the emulsion’s
zeta potential and pH were altered with storage at all temper-
atures. The addition of cryoprotectants stabilized the emulsion
against droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. Fur-
ther works are undergoing in our lab to investigate the stability
of the castor oil-based emulsion following incorporation of
various active pharmaceutical ingredients that range in size
from small molecular drugs (acetazolamide, azithromycin, and
celecoxib) to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.

Abstract. Curcuma comosahas long been used as a gynecological medicine. Several diarylheptanoids have
been purified from this plant, and their pharmacological effects were proven. However, there is no
information about the absorption ofC. comosa components to support the formulation usage. In the
present study, C. comosa hexane extract and the mixture of its two major compounds, (4E,6E)-1,7-
diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2), were formulated into
nanoemulsions. The physical properties of the nanoemulsions and thein situ intestinal absorptions of
DA1 and DA2 were evaluated. The results demonstrated the mean particle sizes at 0.207±0.001 and 0.408
±0.014 μm, and the zeta potential at−14.57±0.85 and−10.47±0.32 mV forC. comosananoemulsion (C.c-
Nano) and mixture of diarlylheptanoid nanoemulsions (DA-Nano), respectively. The entrapments of
DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respec-
tively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/
mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano. The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and
0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm
2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which
were five to ten times faster than those in oil. In conclusion, the formulation in nanoemulsion forms
obviously increased the intestinal absorption rate of diarylheptanoids.

INTRODUCTION
The medicinal plantCurcuma comosaRoxb. (Zingiberaceae)
has been widely used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of uterine
inflammation, postpartum uterinebleeding, premenopausal bleed-
ing, and as an aromatic stomachic. The pharmacological effects of
its hexane extract have been reported including its estrogenic-like
functions (1–3), anti-inflammatory effects (4), choleretic activities
(5,6), hypolipidemic effects (7,8), and memory improvement (9,10).
Among many traditional herbs in Thailand, the formulations of
herbal medicines containingC. comosaare popular in the market
for gynecological conditions. However, all clinical reports related to
C. comosaare empirical, and no information on the absorption
from different formulations has been reported. Recently, several
diarylheptanoids had been purified fromC. comosaextract, and
their pharmacological effects were reported. Two specific mole-
cules, (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-
1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2) (Fig.1), were reported as the
major compounds, which comprised 16.02% and 30.66% of the
crude extract, respectively (11). The estrogenic effect of these two
diarylheptanoids was demonstrated in cell culture studies; thus,
these compounds were consideredas potential phytoestrogens
(12).
The pharmacokinetic profiles of DA1 and DA2 were also
studied in animals (11). TheC. comosaextract that had been
diluted in olive oil was shown to have bioavailability of
24.01% and 34.56% for DA1 and DA2, respectively, after oral
administration. Although increasing the administrated dose
resulted in a greater maximum blood concentration, lower
bioavailability was observed most likely due to the slower
absorption process. The C. comosa hexane extract and the
two diarylheptanoids are lipophilic. Using XLOGP3 software
(13) calculation, the logP values of DA1 and DA2 are 4.36
and 4.87, respectively. The poor water solubility of these
diarylheptanoids was of concern when considering an appro-
priate formulation for sufficient systemic delivery of these
active phytoestrogens.
Nanotechnology has been widely used in the development
of formulations of poorly soluble compounds. Nanoemulsions
usually have droplet sizes at the scale of nanometers, and these
can provide increased apparent water solubility, thermal stabil-
ity, and bioavailability, consequently resulting in improved phar-
macological effects. The benefit of nanoemulsions has been
demonstrated with herbal products such as curcumin (14,15),
St. John's wort extract (16), andKaempferia parvifloraextract
(17). Moreover, nanoemulsions offer the potential to significant-
ly improve the stability and bioavailability of certain carotenoids
such as beta-carotene and astaxanthin (18–
20). The main pur-
pose of the present study was to determine an improvement in

the intestinal absorption ofC. comosaand the diarylheptanoids
when formulated as a nanoemulsion. The related physical charac-
teristics ofC. comosaextract and diarylheptanoids nanoemulsions
were studied, and thein situintestinal absorption of the formula-
tions was evaluated in a commonly used animal model (21,22).
This is a preliminary study to test for the possibility to usein situ
intestinal absorption in rats for measuring the absorption of active
compounds of theC. comosacrude extract. The result provides
simultaneous absorption statusof the mixture of active compounds
in C. comosa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Animals
Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60),
polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 (cetomacrogol 1000), and sodium
chloride were obtained from Asia Pacific Specialty Chemicals
Limited (Australia). Hexane and dichloromethane (HPLC
grade) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (UK). Olive oil
(Sabroso
®, Spain) was obtained from a local vendor. Phenol
red was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA).
Female Wistar rats (8 weeks) were obtained from the
National Animal Center, Mahidol University, Bangkok. The
rats were housed in a room with a controlled temperature of
25±2°C and 12-h dark/light cycles. Standard food (C.P. Ltd.;
code, 082) and water were suppliedad libitum. The experi-
ments were conducted under the National Institute of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publications no. 80-23) revised in 1996 and approved by the
Ethics Committee on Animal Care and Use of Khon Kaen
University.
Plant Extract and the Purified Compounds
C. comosa rhizome was harvested from Nakon Pathom
province, Thailand (identified and provided by Professor
Pawinee Piyachaturawat at Mahidol University, Thailand). A
voucher specimen was filed and kept in our laboratory (BS-C-
03). C. comosa hexane extract was prepared before the ab-
sorption test following our previous report (9). Briefly, dried
samples of C. comosa were mashed to a crude powder and
subsequently extracted inn-hexane using a Soxhlet apparatus
until the outlet hexane was colorless. The hexane fraction was
then evaporated to obtain a brown–yellow oily extract which
was kept at 4°C until use. DA1 and DA2 (>98% purified)
were kindly provided by Professor Apichart Suksamrarn at
Ramkhamhaeng University, Thailand. DA1 and DA2 were
used to standardize the crude extract, in which the concentra-
tion of DA1 and DA2 were 153 and 313 mg/g, respectively. A
HPLC test was run to make sure the extract was stable during
the storage.
HPLC Method Validation and Analysis
An Agilent LC 1200 HPLC system was used with mobile
phase consisting of 35% ofn-hexane and 65% of dichloromethane.
A Hypersil silica column (250 mm×4.6 mm, 5μm, Thermo
®)w a s
used, and the column temperature was set at 25°C. The
flow rate was maintained at 1.5 mL/min, and the detected
wavelengths were 302 nm for DA1 and 250 nm for DA2.
To prepare the standard refe rences, these two purified
diarylheptanoids were separately dissolved in mobile phase to
prepare a five-gradient concentration of 0.25, 0.05, 0.01, 0.002,
and 0.0004 mg/mL followed by the HPLC analysis. Correlation
coefficients (r
2) were subsequently obtained by linear regression
analysis. Inter-day and intra-day precisions were analyzed; the
peak areas of DA1 and DA2 were used for calculating
the coefficient of variation (percent CV). Accuracy and
recovery of the DA1 and DA2 in different solutions were
also evaluated.
For HPLC analysis, the sample was extracted by hex-
ane via vigorous shaking and ultrasonication for 10 min,
followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000×g. The up-
per liquid layer in the centrifuge tube was transferred to
an evaporator dish and dried at room temperature. This
extraction process was repeated in triplicate. The residue
in the evaporator dish was redissolved in 500 μLo fm o -
bile phase for HPLC analysis.
Preparation of Nanoemulations
The oil-in-water nanoemulsion was prepared in two steps
using a co-surfactant method. The oil phase consisted of two
nonionic surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or
Tween 60, and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 or cetomacrogol
1000) and olive oil (TableI). C. comosaextract or the mixture
of DA1 and DA2 were separately added to the warm oil phase
at 70°C and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer. The water
phase (75°C) was then added to form the premix. After homog-
enization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a
speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed
through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics
Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five
cycles to yield the nanoemulsions. The final concentration ofC.
comosaextract nanoemulsion (C.c-Nano) was 0.83 mg/mL, which
contained DA1 and DA2 at concentrations of 0.13 and 0.26 mg/
mL, respectively. The same concentrations of DA1 and DA2
were prepared in the diarylheptanoid mixture nanoemulsion
(DA-Nano).

Preparation ofC. comosaExtract and Mixture of Diarylheptanoid
in Olive Oil
The C. comosa extract was diluted in olive oil to a
concentration of 0.83 mg/mL to produce the C. comosa–
oil solution (C.c-oil). A mixt ure of the diarylheptanoids
was prepared by dissolving DA1 and DA2 in olive oil to
obtain the solution DA-oil containing 0.13 and 0.26 mg/
mL of DA1 and DA2, respectively. All of these four
formulations were tested by HPLC to make sure they
were stable at 37°C for 24 h.
Particle Size and Zeta Potential
The particle sizes of nanoemulsions were determined by
photon correlation spectroscopy using a Mastersizer (version
5.22, Malvern
® Instruments, UK). The zeta potentials of the
nanoemulsions were measured using a Zetasizer (Nano Z,
Malvern
® Instruments, UK).
Morphology of the Nanoemulsions
The morphologies of the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano
nanoemulsions were obtained by using a scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi ® model S-3000N, Tokyo, Japan).
Briefly, a drop of a freshly prepared formulation was directly
applied on the holey film grid followed by drying at room
temperature overnight. The sample was coated with gold for
20 min using an ion sputtering device before the scanning.
Entrapment Efficiency and Drug Loading Ratio of Nanoemulsions
Entrapment efficiency and drug loading ratio of the
nanoemulsions were determined using a centrifugal filtra-
tion device (Microcon
® Milllipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
fitted with a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter. Two
hundred microliters of the nanoemulsion was added to the
sample reservoir of the Microcon ® system and then
centrifuged at 1,500× g for 45 min at 4°C to separate
the entrapped and unentrapped contents. The sample
reservoir was washed twice with 100 μLo fd e i o n i z e d
water and was followed by collection of the entire
filtrate. The diarylheptanoi ds entrapped on the filter as
well as the unentrapped drug in the filtrate were analyzed
by HPLC. The entrapment efficiency (percent EE) and
drug loading ratio (DL ratio) were calculated using the
following equations:
%EE ¼

In SituAbsorption Study
All animals were fasted 24 h before the initiation of the
experiments and were allowed waterad libitum. Twelve ani-
mals were randomly separated into four groups (n=3) and
administered the four formulations, including C.c-Nano, DA-
Nano, C.c-oil, and DA-oil. The animals were anesthetized
under ether and then positioned on the operation stage in
supine position. Ether was carefully supplied by observing
the respiration of the animals to make sure of the anesthetic
status. A 5-cm incision was made in the abdomen to expose
the intestines. Two incisions were made in the small intes-
tine; a sterile influent tube was inserted in the proximal
end, and an effluent tube was connected to the distal end,
both of which were ligated to prevent leakage. After
washing out the intestinal contents with normal saline at
37°C, the drug-containing sample at 37°C from a sample
pool was pumped through the intestine at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/min, and the effluent was recycled into the sample
pool. After achieving a constant flow rate, 200 μLo f
solution was collected from the sample pool at every
10 min for 1 h. The effluent volume of each collected
sample was measured and used for compensating the vol-
ume absorbed by the intestine. After all samples had been
collected, the animals were sacrificed by ether overdose.
The surface area of the small intestine segment used in
the perfusion study was measured. The final absorption
rates of the two diarylheptanoids were expressed as mi-
crogram per minute per square centimeter. All perfusion
studies in rats were performed in triplicate for each for-
mulation. The blank nanoemulsion (without the plant ex-
tract) containing a nonabsorbable marker, phenol red, at a

RESULTS
HPLC Validation
This HPLC assay was able to achieve a good separation
of DA1 and DA2 with retention times of 16.35 and 13.29 min
when detected at the wavelength of 302 and 250 nm, respec-
tively (Figs.2c–f and 3c–f). The correlation coefficients of all
calibration curves of these two compounds showed good line-
arity (r
2>0.999) over the test range. The percent coefficient of
variation (%CV) of the method precision and accuracy were
less than 0.75 and 0.77, respectively; these values were 1.39
and 1.13 for intra- and inter-day assays, respectively. The limit of
detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of both
DA1 and DA2 were 0.0001 and 0.0003 mg/mL, respectively. The
average recovery was 96.8% for DA1 and 98.7% for DA2
(TableII). The after-perfused blank oil and nanoemulsion did not
interfere with the detection of DA1 and DA2 under the current
conditions (Figs.2a, band 3a, b). The results indicated that the
analytical method was reliable and reproducible.

1059Increased In SituIntestinal Absorption of Diarylheptanoids
Physical Characteristics of the Nanoemulsions
The particle size distributions of the nanoemulsions were
uniform with mean values of 0.207±0.001 and 0.408±0.014μm
for the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations, respectively
(Table III, Fig.4). When stored at 4°C, these two formulations
were stable as it was observed that their mean particle sizes
were not changed (0.208±0.001 and 0.414±0.002μm, respec-
tively). The entrapment efficiencies and drug loading ratios of
DA1 and DA2 in the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano emulsions as
well as the zeta potential of the nanoemulsions are reported in
Table IV. These results showed that the entrapment efficien-
cies for DA1 and DA2 were similar for both nanoemulsions,
but that the drug loading of these compounds was greater for
the C.c-Nano emulsion. Both emulsions exhibited slightly
negative zeta potentials.
In SituIntestinal Absorption
After in situintestinal perfusion of the blank nanoemulsion
containing phenol red marker, the obtained perfusate showed
no leakage of phenol red as it was observed that the concentra-
tions of phenol red were not changed from the original blank
nanoemulsion. The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2
from different formulations as shown in TableV demonstrated
that the absorption of DA1 and DA2 in the nanoemulsions was
more rapid than when they were formulated in oils. The absorp-
tion of DA2 when administered in the C.c-Nano emulsion was
notably faster than when formulated in the DA-Nano emulsion.
Compared to the formulation in oils, the concentrations of DA1
and DA2 in the sample pool of the formulation in
nanoemulsions decreased more rapidly (Fig.5). This is another
indication that DA1 and DA2 were more rapidly absorbed
when formulated in nanoemulsions.
DISCUSSION
Many in vitrostudies have been conducted on the pharma-
cological activity of compounds that have been isolated and
purified from plants. However, further development of most of
these compounds has been aborted because effective blood
concentrations could not be attained, primarily due to their
physical–chemical properties such as solubility, partition coeffi-
cient, lipophilicity, and crystallinity. In the present study, the
hexane extract ofC. comosaand the two diarylheptanoids were
lipophilic. In previous studies, the hexane extract ofC. comosa
extract was diluted in corn oil or olive oil to prepare formula-
tions for administration of the animals (3,9). To reach a phar-
macologically effective blood level, doses of 125–500 mg/kg
body weight were administered (3,10). Pharmacokinetic analysis
showed that the bioavailability of the major compounds (DA1
and DA2) ofC. comosa extract were reduced by 35% when
dosed at 125 mg/kg in olive oil and that this value was further
reduced when the dose was increased to 250 mg/kg (11). For-
mulating theC. comosaextract and the diarylheptanoids into a
nanoemulsion can improve the intestinal absorption and in-
crease the absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 by five- to tenfold.
Higher bioavailability with lower administered doses ofC.
comosa extract and diarylheptanoids was expected by formulat-
ing them in nanoemulsions. The improvement in the absorption
of the nanoemulsion was evidently due to the smaller droplet
sizes and the presence of surfactants which might aid access of
the lipophilic compounds to the intestine mucosa. The improve-
ment in absorption of the active compounds in the
nanoemulsion was similar to that observed for other compounds
such as St. John's wort extract in which formulation in a
nanoemulsion resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in bioavailability
compared to the general extract formulation (16). Moreover, a
curcumin nanoemulsion was reported to be comparable to the
activity of free curcuminin vitro against a panel of human
pancreatic cancer cell lines (14).
In this study, the nanoemulsions were prepared by a two-
step homogenization method. The first step was performed to
yield a pre-emulsion; this was followed by high-pressure ho-
mogenization to generate a nanosized diarylheptanoid emul-
sion. Both Tween 60 and cetomacrogol 1000 are nonionic
surfactants that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical
products based on their safety and compatibility. The amounts

of these compounds in the formulation were under their LD50
values (60 mL/kg and 2–4 g/kg, respectively) (23). Olive oil
was used due to its ability to solubilize diarylheptanoids. The
obtained nanoemulsion droplets were monodisphere and
spherical with diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm and zeta
potentials less than−10 mV (24). High entrapment efficiencies
and drug loading ratios of both DA1 and DA2 in the
nanoemulsion were observed. By thein situabsorption, there
were no changes in the concentrations of phenol red in the
after intestinal perfusate, indicating that the absorption of
DA1 and DA2 from C.c-Nano and DA-Nano was not induced
by a physical leakage, such as the tight-junction damage.
However, the possible mechanism of this increase of intestinal
absorption needed further investigation. These results suggest
that nanoemulsions of these compounds can improve their
absorption and bioavailability for further enhancement of
their therapeutic efficiency.
The C. comosa extract and DAs were stable in their
oil solution. However, their conventional emulsions with a
mean particle size of 14–16 μm were not stable with phase
separation evident within 1 h, so that an absorption test
could not be performed. The stability of the nanoemulsion
was much greater while the particle size of both C.c-nano
and DA-nano formulations did not change as observed at
14 days. Moreover, after keeping the formulations up to
3 months, there were no changes in their physical appear-
ance. It is noticed that the particle size of DA-Nano was
twofold larger than that o f the C.c-Nano emulsion
(Table III). This might be because the crude extract
contained more components than just two purified com-
pounds. These components mi ght function as co-surfac-
tants, which were initially partitioned into the interface,
reducing the energy of the interface and removing the
hydrophobic parts of the surfactant from contacts with
water, finally resulting in the smaller particle size of crude
extract formulation than that containing of DA1 and DA2
(25). More interestingly, the smaller particle size resulted
in the increased absorption of DA2 but not of DA1
(Fig. 5). The reason was unknown, but it provided the
information of how particle sizes affect the absorption of
DA1 and DA2.
Although higher absorption rates of diarylheptanoids
were observed when formulated in nanoemulsions, a demon-
stration of greater bioavailability needed to be obtained. After
the active compounds were absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract, their concentrations in blood were also dependent on
the first pass liver metabolism as well as by post-hepatic
enzymes. Further study on the metabolite pattern of the
diarylheptanoids is essential. Nanoemulsions may also induce
changes in the absorption pattern of the other compounds
included in the crude extract. Thus, pharmacological and tox-
icological studies ofC. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids
formulated in nanoemulsions are also required.
CONCLUSION
Nanoemulsions containing diarylheptanoids orC. comosa
extract were successfully prepared by a two-step process. The-
se nanoemulsions were uniform and had high entrapment
efficiencies and drug loading ratios. The intestinal absorption
