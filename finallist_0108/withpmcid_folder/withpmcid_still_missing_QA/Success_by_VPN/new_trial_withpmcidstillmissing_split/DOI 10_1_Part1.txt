=== Part1 ANALYSIS ===
SUMMARY:
The study successfully developed stable oil-in-water nanoemulsions to significantly improve the intestinal absorption of lipophilic phytoestrogenic diarylheptanoids (DA1 and DA2) from Curcuma comosa. Utilizing a two-step homogenization co-surfactant method with Tween 60, cetomacrogol 1000, and olive oil, formulations (C.c-Nano and DA-Nano) exhibited small mean particle sizes (0.207 μm and 0.408 μm, respectively) and high entrapment efficiencies (71-76%). A key finding was the 5 to 10-fold increase in the in situ intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 in nanoemulsions compared to conventional oil formulations, primarily attributed to reduced droplet size and surfactant activity facilitating access to the intestinal mucosa. This formulation strategy holds considerable promise for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and clinical utility of these poorly water-soluble compounds.

========================================

Q: 1. What was the primary finding regarding the intestinal absorption of diarylheptanoids when formulated as nanoemulsions?
A: The primary finding was that the intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 in nanoemulsions were five to ten times faster than those in oil. This is explicitly stated as the conclusion in the abstract, highlighting the significant improvement achieved by nanoemulsion formulation.
Source: Curcuma comosahas long been used as a gynecological medicine. Several diarylheptanoids have been purified from this plant, and their pharmacological effects were proven. However, there is no information about the absorption ofC. comosa components to support the formulation usage. In the present study, C. comosa hexane extract and the mixture of its two major compounds, (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2), were formulated into nanoemulsions. The physical properties of the nanoemulsions and thein situ intestinal absorptions of DA1 and DA2 were evaluated. The results demonstrated the mean particle sizes at 0.207±0.001 and 0.408 ±0.014 μm, and the zeta potential at−14.57±0.85 and−10.47±0.32 mV forC. comosananoemulsion (C.c-Nano) and mixture of diarlylheptanoid nanoemulsions (DA-Nano), respectively. The entrapments of DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respec- tively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/ mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano. The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which were five to ten times faster than those in oil. In conclusion, the formulation in nanoemulsion forms obviously increased the intestinal absorption rate of diarylheptanoids.
------------------------------
Q: 2. What are the key physicochemical properties of the diarylheptanoids DA1 and DA2 that posed a challenge for their formulation?
A: The key physicochemical properties of DA1 and DA2 are their lipophilicity and poor water solubility. This is indicated by their logP values of 4.36 for DA1 and 4.87 for DA2, which signify a high affinity for lipid environments and low aqueous solubility, making systemic delivery challenging.
Source: The C. comosa hexane extract and the two diarylheptanoids are lipophilic. Using XLOGP3 software (13) calculation, the logP values of DA1 and DA2 are 4.36 and 4.87, respectively. The poor water solubility of these diarylheptanoids was of concern when considering an appropriate formulation for sufficient systemic delivery of these active phytoestrogens.
------------------------------
Q: 3. For what traditional medicinal purposes is Curcuma comosa utilized in Southeast Asia?
A: Curcuma comosa is widely used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of uterine inflammation, postpartum uterine bleeding, premenopausal bleeding, and as an aromatic stomachic. Its hexane extract has also been reported for estrogenic-like, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, hypolipidemic, and memory improvement effects.
Source: The medicinal plantCurcuma comosaRoxb. (Zingiberaceae) has been widely used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of uterine inflammation, postpartum uterinebleeding, premenopausal bleed- ing, and as an aromatic stomachic. The pharmacological effects of its hexane extract have been reported including its estrogenic-like functions (1–3), anti-inflammatory effects (4), choleretic activities (5,6), hypolipidemic effects (7,8), and memory improvement (9,10).
------------------------------
Q: 4. What are the two major diarylheptanoid compounds identified in Curcuma comosa extract, and what percentages do they comprise?
A: The two major diarylheptanoid compounds are (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2). They comprised 16.02% and 30.66% of the crude extract, respectively, and are considered potential phytoestrogens due to their demonstrated estrogenic effect.
Source: Recently, several diarylheptanoids had been purified fromC. comosaextract, and their pharmacological effects were reported. Two specific mole- cules, (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2) (Fig.1), were reported as the major compounds, which comprised 16.02% and 30.66% of the crude extract, respectively (11). The estrogenic effect of these two diarylheptanoids was demonstrated in cell culture studies; thus, these compounds were consideredas potential phytoestrogens (12).
------------------------------
Q: 5. What was the observed bioavailability of DA1 and DA2 when formulated in olive oil, and how did increasing the dose affect bioavailability?
A: When formulated in olive oil, the bioavailability was 24.01% for DA1 and 34.56% for DA2 after oral administration. Increasing the administered dose resulted in a lower bioavailability, despite a greater maximum blood concentration, likely due to a slower absorption process.
Source: The pharmacokinetic profiles of DA1 and DA2 were also studied in animals (11). TheC. comosaextract that had been diluted in olive oil was shown to have bioavailability of 24.01% and 34.56% for DA1 and DA2, respectively, after oral administration. Although increasing the administrated dose resulted in a greater maximum blood concentration, lower bioavailability was observed most likely due to the slower absorption process.
------------------------------
Q: 6. How do nanoemulsions address the challenges posed by poorly soluble compounds like diarylheptanoids?
A: Nanoemulsions address the challenges of poorly soluble compounds by providing increased apparent water solubility, thermal stability, and bioavailability due to their nanometer-scale droplet sizes. This ultimately leads to improved pharmacological effects, as demonstrated with other herbal products.
Source: Nanotechnology has been widely used in the development of formulations of poorly soluble compounds. Nanoemulsions usually have droplet sizes at the scale of nanometers, and these can provide increased apparent water solubility, thermal stabil- ity, and bioavailability, consequently resulting in improved phar- macological effects. The benefit of nanoemulsions has been demonstrated with herbal products such as curcumin (14,15), St. John's wort extract (16), andKaempferia parvifloraextract (17).
------------------------------
Q: 7. Describe the two-step homogenization method used to prepare the oil-in-water nanoemulsions.
A: The nanoemulsions were prepared using a two-step co-surfactant method. First, the `C. comosa` extract or DA1/DA2 mixture was added to the warm oil phase (Tween 60, cetomacrogol 1000, olive oil) at 70°C, followed by the addition of the water phase (75°C) to form a premix. Second, this premix was homogenized with a homomixer at 2,000 rpm for 20 minutes to form a pre-emulsion, which was then passed through a high-pressure homogenizer at 10,000 psi for five cycles to yield the final nanoemulsions.
Source: The oil-in-water nanoemulsion was prepared in two steps using a co-surfactant method. The oil phase consisted of two nonionic surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or Tween 60, and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 or cetomacrogol 1000) and olive oil (TableI). C. comosaextract or the mixture of DA1 and DA2 were separately added to the warm oil phase at 70°C and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer. The water phase (75°C) was then added to form the premix. After homog- enization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five cycles to yield the nanoemulsions.
------------------------------
Q: 8. Which nonionic surfactants were employed in the nanoemulsion formulation, and what is their role?
A: Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 (cetomacrogol 1000) were the nonionic surfactants used. Their role is to stabilize the oil-in-water nanoemulsion by reducing interfacial tension and forming a stable interfacial film around the oil droplets, preventing coalescence.

------------------------------
Q: 9. Why was olive oil selected as a component for the nanoemulsion formulations?
A: Olive oil was selected because of its ability to solubilize the lipophilic diarylheptanoids. This is critical for incorporating the active compounds into the oil phase of the nanoemulsion before emulsification.
Source: The amounts of these compounds in the formulation were under their LD50 values (60 mL/kg and 2–4 g/kg, respectively) (23). Olive oil was used due to its ability to solubilize diarylheptanoids.
------------------------------
Q: 10. Compare the mean particle sizes and zeta potentials of the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations.
A: The C.c-Nano formulation had a mean particle size of 0.207±0.001 μm and a zeta potential of −14.57±0.85 mV. The DA-Nano formulation had a mean particle size of 0.408±0.014 μm and a zeta potential of −10.47±0.32 mV. The C.c-Nano exhibited a smaller particle size and a slightly more negative zeta potential.
Source: The results demonstrated the mean particle sizes at 0.207±0.001 and 0.408 ±0.014 μm, and the zeta potential at−14.57±0.85 and−10.47±0.32 mV forC. comosananoemulsion (C.c-Nano) and mixture of diarlylheptanoid nanoemulsions (DA-Nano), respectively. The entrapments of DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respec- tively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/ mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano.
------------------------------
Q: 11. What were the entrapment efficiencies and drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 in both C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations?
A: For C.c-Nano, the entrapment efficiencies were 76.61% for DA1 and 75.41% for DA2, with drug loading ratios of 351.47 μg/mg for DA1 and 614.53 μg/mg for DA2. For DA-Nano, the entrapment efficiencies were 71.91% for DA1 and 71.63% for DA2, with drug loading ratios of 59.48 μg/mg for DA1 and 126.72 μg/mg for DA2.
Source: The entrapments of DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respec- tively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/ mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano.
------------------------------
Q: 12. What control measure was implemented in the *in situ* intestinal absorption study to ensure that observed absorption was not due to physical leakage?
A: A blank nanoemulsion containing phenol red, a nonabsorbable marker at 30 μg/mL, was tested as a control group. The fact that the concentrations of phenol red in the perfusate did not change indicated no leakage and confirmed that absorption of DA1 and DA2 was not due to physical damage to the tight junctions.
Source: All animals were fasted 24 h before the initiation of the experiments and were allowed waterad libitum. Twelve ani- mals were randomly separated into four groups (n=3) and administered the four formulations, including C.c-Nano, DA- Nano, C.c-oil, and DA-oil. The animals were anesthetized under ether and then positioned on the operation stage in supine position. Ether was carefully supplied by observing the respiration of the animals to make sure of the anesthetic status. A 5-cm incision was made in the abdomen to expose the intestines. Two incisions were made in the small intes- tine; a sterile influent tube was inserted in the proximal end, and an effluent tube was connected to the distal end, both of which were ligated to prevent leakage. After washing out the intestinal contents with normal saline at 37°C, the drug-containing sample at 37°C from a sample pool was pumped through the intestine at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, and the effluent was recycled into the sample pool. After achieving a constant flow rate, 200 μLo f solution was collected from the sample pool at every 10 min for 1 h. The effluent volume of each collected sample was measured and used for compensating the vol- ume absorbed by the intestine. After all samples had been collected, the animals were sacrificed by ether overdose. The surface area of the small intestine segment used in the perfusion study was measured. The final absorption rates of the two diarylheptanoids were expressed as mi- crogram per minute per square centimeter. All perfusion studies in rats were performed in triplicate for each for- mulation. The blank nanoemulsion (without the plant ex- tract) containing a nonabsorbable marker, phenol red, at a concentration of 30 μg/mL was also tested as the control group (22).
------------------------------
Q: 13. Quantify the *in situ* intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 for C.c-Nano and DA-oil formulations.
A: For C.c-Nano, the absorption rate of DA1 was 0.329±0.015 μg/min/cm2, and for DA2, it was 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm2. For DA-oil, the absorption rate of DA1 was 0.028±0.006 μg/min/cm2, and for DA2, it was 0.034±0.002 μg/min/cm2. This clearly shows the significantly higher absorption rates achieved with the nanoemulsion formulation.
Source: The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 from different formulations as shown in TableV demonstrated that the absorption of DA1 and DA2 in the nanoemulsions was more rapid than when they were formulated in oils. The absorption of DA2 when administered in the C.c-Nano emulsion was notably faster than when formulated in the DA-Nano emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 14. What are the proposed mechanisms by which nanoemulsions improve the intestinal absorption of lipophilic compounds like diarylheptanoids?
A: The improvement in absorption by nanoemulsions is primarily attributed to smaller droplet sizes and the presence of surfactants. Smaller droplets increase the surface area for absorption and facilitate access of the lipophilic compounds to the intestinal mucosa by potentially bypassing some physiological barriers or enhancing solubility in the intestinal fluid.
Source: Formulating theC. comosaextract and the diarylheptanoids into a nanoemulsion can improve the intestinal absorption and in- crease the absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 by five- to tenfold. Higher bioavailability with lower administered doses ofC. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids was expected by formulat- ing them in nanoemulsions. The improvement in the absorption of the nanoemulsion was evidently due to the smaller droplet sizes and the presence of surfactants which might aid access of the lipophilic compounds to the intestine mucosa.
------------------------------
Q: 15. What stability issues were observed with conventional emulsions of *C. comosa* extract and diarylheptanoids, and how did nanoemulsions address this?
A: Conventional emulsions of *C. comosa* extract and diarylheptanoids, with a mean particle size of 14–16 μm, were not stable, exhibiting phase separation within 1 hour, which prevented absorption testing. In contrast, the nanoemulsions demonstrated much greater stability, with no changes in particle size after 14 days and no alterations in physical appearance for up to 3 months.
Source: The C. comosa extract and DAs were stable in their oil solution. However, their conventional emulsions with a mean particle size of 14–16 μm were not stable with phase separation evident within 1 h, so that an absorption test could not be performed. The stability of the nanoemulsion was much greater while the particle size of both C.c-nano and DA-nano formulations did not change as observed at 14 days. Moreover, after keeping the formulations up to 3 months, there were no changes in their physical appear- ance.
------------------------------
Q: 16. Why was the particle size of DA-Nano observed to be larger than that of C.c-Nano, and what is the proposed explanation?
A: The particle size of DA-Nano (0.408 ± 0.014 μm) was twofold larger than C.c-Nano (0.207 ± 0.001 μm). The proposed explanation is that the crude *C. comosa* extract in C.c-Nano contains additional components beyond DA1 and DA2. These components may act as co-surfactants, partitioning into the oil-water interface, reducing interfacial energy, and leading to smaller droplet sizes in the crude extract formulation compared to the purified DA1 and DA2 mixture.
Source: It is noticed that the particle size of DA-Nano was twofold larger than that o f the C.c-Nano emulsion (Table III). This might be because the crude extract contained more components than just two purified com- pounds. These components mi ght function as co-surfac- tants, which were initially partitioned into the interface, reducing the energy of the interface and removing the hydrophobic parts of the surfactant from contacts with water, finally resulting in the smaller particle size of crude extract formulation than that containing of DA1 and DA2 (25).
------------------------------
Q: 17. What differential effect did smaller particle size have on the absorption of DA1 and DA2?
A: The smaller particle size resulted in increased absorption of DA2 but did not affect the absorption of DA1. While the exact reason for this differential effect was unknown, it highlights that particle size can have compound-specific impacts on absorption within a formulation.
Source: More interestingly, the smaller particle size resulted in the increased absorption of DA2 but not of DA1 (Fig. 5). The reason was unknown, but it provided the information of how particle sizes affect the absorption of DA1 and DA2.
------------------------------
Q: 18. What crucial aspects need to be investigated in future studies to fully understand the impact of nanoemulsion formulation on diarylheptanoids?
A: Future studies need to demonstrate greater bioavailability, investigate the impact of first-pass liver metabolism and post-hepatic enzymes on blood concentrations, and determine the metabolite pattern of diarylheptanoids. Additionally, pharmacological and toxicological studies of the *C. comosa* extract and diarylheptanoids formulated in nanoemulsions are required, as nanoemulsions might alter the absorption patterns of other crude extract compounds.
Source: Although higher absorption rates of diarylheptanoids were observed when formulated in nanoemulsions, a demon- stration of greater bioavailability needed to be obtained. After the active compounds were absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, their concentrations in blood were also dependent on the first pass liver metabolism as well as by post-hepatic enzymes. Further study on the metabolite pattern of the diarylheptanoids is essential. Nanoemulsions may also induce changes in the absorption pattern of the other compounds included in the crude extract. Thus, pharmacological and tox- icological studies ofC. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids formulated in nanoemulsions are also required.
------------------------------
Q: 19. What were the target final concentrations of DA1 and DA2 in the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations?
A: The target final concentration of DA1 was 0.13 mg/mL, and for DA2, it was 0.26 mg/mL in both the *C. comosa* extract nanoemulsion (C.c-Nano) and the diarylheptanoid mixture nanoemulsion (DA-Nano). The C.c-Nano itself had an overall extract concentration of 0.83 mg/mL.
Source: The final concentration ofC. comosaextract nanoemulsion (C.c-Nano) was 0.83 mg/mL, which contained DA1 and DA2 at concentrations of 0.13 and 0.26 mg/ mL, respectively. The same concentrations of DA1 and DA2 were prepared in the diarylheptanoid mixture nanoemulsion (DA-Nano).
------------------------------
Q: 20. What are the critical parameters for the high-pressure homogenization step during nanoemulsion preparation that might impact scale-up manufacturing?
A: The critical parameters for the high-pressure homogenization step are the pressure of 10,000 psi and the number of cycles, which was five. These parameters directly influence droplet size reduction and uniformity. During scale-up, maintaining consistent high pressure and optimizing the number of cycles will be crucial to ensure reproducibility of particle size distribution and stability for large-batch manufacturing, requiring robust and high-capacity homogenization equipment.
Source: After homog- enization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five cycles to yield the nanoemulsions.
