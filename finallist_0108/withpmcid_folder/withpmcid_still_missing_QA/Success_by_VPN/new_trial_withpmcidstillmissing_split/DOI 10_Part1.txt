=== Part1 ANALYSIS ===
SUMMARY:
This study developed and assessed the kinetic stability of a phospholipidless, castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion featuring cationic droplets stabilized by a poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film. The formulation demonstrated robust physical stability, maintaining a consistent mean droplet diameter (218–250 nm) over 6 months across various temperatures (4°C, 25°C, 37°C), including after thermal processing and accelerated mechanical stress. While pH and zeta potential progressively decreased at higher temperatures due to free fatty acid liberation, the combined steric and electrostatic repulsion provided by the emulsifier film effectively prevented droplet aggregation. Crucially, the addition of 5% w/w sucrose and 5% w/w sorbitol significantly improved emulsion stability against aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling by limiting ice crystal formation and enhancing interfacial protection. This nano-sized emulsion offers a promising, stable vehicle for incorporating diverse active pharmaceutical ingredients, from small molecules to macromolecules, without the issues associated with phospholipid degradation.

Q: 2. What significant changes were observed in the mean droplet diameter, pH, and zeta potential of the emulsion during storage at different temperatures over 6 months?
A: No significant change was noted in the mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets across all storage temperatures (4°C, 25°C, 37°C) for up to 6 months. However, the emulsion stored at 37°C showed a progressive decrease in both pH and zeta potential values, a phenomenon not observed at lower temperatures. This indicates that chemical degradation, specifically free fatty acid formation from castor oil, is accelerated at higher temperatures, leading to a reduction in pH and zeta potential.
Source: Presence of cryoprotectants (5%,w/w, sucrose +5%, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C over a period of up to 6 months, no signiﬁcant change was noted in mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did not. This indicates that at 37°C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values. Thus, the injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion could be useful for incorporating various active pharmaceutical ingredients that are in size from small molecular drugs to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.
------------------------------
Q: 3. How did cryoprotectants influence the stability of the nano-sized emulsion to freeze–thaw cycling?
A: The presence of cryoprotectants (5% w/w sucrose + 5% w/w sorbitol) significantly improved the stability of the emulsions, preventing droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. This is crucial for maintaining the physical integrity and particle size distribution of the formulation under extreme temperature fluctuations.

------------------------------
Q: 4. What are the primary instability processes that an oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion is susceptible to, according to thermodynamic principles?
A: An o/w nano-sized emulsion, being a meta-stable dispersion, is subjected to various instability processes such as aggregation, flocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and eventual phase separation. These processes occur due to the inherent thermodynamic instability of heterogeneous dispersions.
Source: According to the second law of thermodynamics, the o/w nano-sized emulsion is subjected to various instability processes like aggregation, ﬂocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and hence even-tual phase separation (1,2). Unlike microemulsions which are thermodynamically stable and clear transparent liquid system, macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions are meta-stable dispersions.
------------------------------
Q: 5. How do suitable emulsifiers or emulgators improve the stability of oil-in-water nano-sized emulsions?
A: Emulsifiers improve stability by forming a mono- or multilayer coating film around the dispersed oil droplets. This film serves two main functions: it reduces interfacial tension between the oil and water phases, and it increases droplet–droplet repulsion, thereby minimizing aggregation and coalescence.
Source: However, the stability of the o/w macro (coarse)-and nano-sized emulsions can substantially be improved with the help of suitable emulsiﬁers or emulgators that are capable of forming a mono- or multilayer coating ﬁlm around the dispersed oil droplets in order to reduce interfacial tension and to increase droplet– droplet repulsion (3).
------------------------------
Q: 6. What are the key advantages of using nano-sized emulsion systems as drug delivery vehicles?
A: Nano-sized emulsion systems offer several advantages including natural biodegradability, a sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization in either the oil phase or at the oil-water interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability. These characteristics make them promising for parenteral and topical drug delivery applications.
Source: The advantages of the nano-sized emulsion system include: natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization either at the innermost oil phase or at the o/w interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability (4). Due to these advantages, the nano-sized emulsion is now recognized as a promising drug delivery vehicle or carrier for parenteral (5) and topical (ocular and percutaneous) (5,6) applications.
------------------------------
Q: 7. What is a known stability issue associated with phospholipid-containing nano-sized emulsions, even with antioxidant inclusion?
A: Even with the addition of antioxidants like α-tocopherol, phospholipid-containing emulsions are prone to the liberation of free fatty acids from phospholipid components. This leads to the generation of a microclimate acidic pH in the vicinity of the oil phase, oil–water interface, and water phase of the emulsion, which can be detrimental to pH-sensitive drug molecules and overall emulsion stability.
Source: Antioxidants such asα-tocopherol was also included in most of the developed nano-sized emulsions in order to prevent the oxidative degradation of phospholipid or other emulsion components and thus the minimization of free fatty acid formation in phospholipid-based emulsions following autoclave sterilization and subsequent storage at stipulated conditions. However, even with the addition of antioxidants, the phospholipid-containing emulsion was prone to the liberation of free fatty acids (from phospholipid components), leading to the generation microclimate acidic pH in the vicinity of the oil phase, oil– water interface, and water phase of the emulsion (8,9).
------------------------------
Q: 8. Why was the development of a phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion considered necessary, particularly for peptide or protein incorporation?
A: The development of a phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion was necessary because the liberation of free fatty acids in phospholipid-stabilized emulsions, or the need for pH adjustment with mild alkali, could lead to the structural degradation or modification of incorporated peptide or protein molecules. A phospholipidless system avoids these issues while aiming to maintain kinetic stability.
Source: If free fatty acid was released or mild alkali solution was added during the formulation of phospholipid-stabilized emulsion, then incorporation of peptide or protein into the emulsion might be questionable due to its possible structural degradation/modi ﬁcation. In this context, it becomes necessary to develop an emulsion without the addition of phospholipid emulgator but still shows the required kinetic stability for at least over months. Therefore, castor oil, poloxamer– chitosan, and water are being selected respectively as the model oil– emulgators– water components to prepare the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 9. Describe the key steps involved in the preparation of the phospholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion.
A: The preparation involved pre-heating castor oil with α-tocopherol, chitosan in acetic acid, and poloxamer 188 with glycerin in water separately to 70°C. These solutions were then combined, magnetically stirred, further heated to 85°C, high-shear mixed for 5 minutes, and rapidly cooled below 20°C. The crude emulsion was then homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer at 9000 psi for 5 minutes, followed by filtration through a 0.45 μm membrane filter, nitrogen packing, and steam sterilization at 121°C for 15 minutes.
Source: In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα-tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C. Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer. The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of 85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica, Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below 20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer, APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in. 2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then ﬁltered through a TE membrane ﬁlter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany) with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min.
------------------------------
Q: 10. Why was castor oil selected as the oil phase for the nano-sized emulsion, despite previous reports of its instability in phospholipid-stabilized emulsions?
A: Castor oil was selected because preliminary experiments showed that other common digestible oils (medium-chain triglycerides, soybean oil, sesame seed oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil) failed to produce a stable emulsion system with the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier combination. Furthermore, castor oil demonstrated a higher solubilization capacity for peptidic molecules like cyclosporin A, which is crucial for drug incorporation, overriding concerns from its previous instability in phospholipid-stabilized systems.
Source: In our preliminary experiments, none of the aforementioned oils is able to produce a stable emulsion system when poloxamer– chitosan emulsiﬁer combination is used. Previous literature references show that using corn oil as the oil phase and lecithin– chitosan as the emulsiﬁer combination resulted in a stable emulsion system (10,11). In addition, it was shown previously in the phospholipid-stabilized emulsion that when using castor oil as a single oil phase, the ﬁnal emulsion did not show stable behavior in the long-term stability ( 12). But it was our experience that in comparison to other oils, castor oil has higher solubilization capacity to dissolve peptidic molecule like cyclosporin A (9).
------------------------------
Q: 11. What were the observed mean droplet diameter and zeta potential of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion, and what mechanism contributes to its stabilization?
A: The freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion exhibited a mean droplet diameter in the range of 218–250 nm with a monodispersed droplet size distribution, and a positive zeta potential (e.g., +41.4 mV). Stabilization is attributed to the combination of steric repulsion provided by nonionic poloxamer molecules and electrostatic repulsion from cationic chitosan molecules, which are localized and intercalated at the oil–water interface to form a mixed emulgator film.
Source: Table I shows mean droplet diameter of the o/w nano-sized emulsion. The mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218– 250 nm and presented a monodispersed droplet size distribution. As expected, the zeta potential of the developed emulsion was also in positive unit due to the presence of cationic polysaccharide (chitosan) at the mixed emulgator ﬁlm. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. In addition, the viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion for-mulation was measured and found to be 1.5 cps.
------------------------------
Q: 12. How does the presence of free fatty acids in castor oil potentially contribute to the stability of the nano-sized emulsion after autoclave sterilization?
A: Castor oil naturally contains traces of ricinoleic acid, and additional free fatty acids can be liberated during autoclave sterilization. These negatively charged fatty acids are hypothesized to interact with the positively charged chitosan in the emulsifier film, potentially acquiring mild emulsification properties, which contributes to the overall substantial stability of the emulsion after thermal processing.
Source: Furthermore, the substantial stability shown by phos-pholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion even after autoclave sterilization could reasonably be attributed to the following explanation. Castor oil is known to contain traces of free fatty acid (recinoleic acid), and even some amount of fatty acid is likely to be liberated after autoclave sterilization. After interaction with positively charged chitosan, the negatively charged fatty acids might acquire mild emulsiﬁcation property (14).
------------------------------
Q: 13. Detail the changes in zeta potential of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion when stored at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C for up to 6 months.
A: The initial zeta potential of the fresh emulsion was +41.4 mV. After 6 months of storage, the zeta potential decreased to +30.6 ± 1.37 mV at 37°C, to +37.2 ± 2.35 mV at 25°C, and remained relatively stable at +37.8 ± 0.89 mV at 4°C. These statistically significant differences indicate that lower temperatures are more effective in preserving the emulsified particle's surface charge over time, thereby minimizing electrostatic repulsion loss.
Source: Immediately after the preparation of fresh emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV (Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization at elevated temperature. Keeping the emulsion at 37°C for up to 6 months decreased the zeta potential to +30.6±1.37 mV. The same emulsion stored at 25°C showed a lesser reduction in the zeta potential (+37.2±2.35 mV). At 4°C, the zeta potential of the emulsion was still found to be +37.8±0.89 mV. Statistical analysis of these data revealed signiﬁcant differ-ences (p<0.05; Table I). From this result, it appears that the lowest temperature was more adequate for castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion storage in terms of the emulsi ﬁed particle’s surface charge. It should be emphasized that an excessive shaking (100 strokes/minutes over 24 h) of the emulsion was performed following the completion of the storage conditions in order to verify the inﬂuence of the storage conditions and mechanical stress on the droplet diameter. No change in the mean droplet diameter was observed, indicating the lack of any inﬂuence before and after shaking of the emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 14. Explain the observed changes in pH of the nano-sized emulsion during storage at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C, and the underlying reason.
A: The initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0. During storage, a progressive reduction in pH was observed, specifically 1 to 4 units at 37°C and a lesser reduction at 25°C. At 4°C, pH reduction only commenced after 2 months and was less pronounced, decreasing by only one unit. The primary reason for this pH reduction is the temperature-dependent liberation of free fatty acids from castor oil, with higher temperatures accelerating this hydrolytic degradation process.
Source: The figure clearly shows the reduction of the emulsion’s pH at 25°C and 37°C. It should be noted that the initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0 using a mild acid before subjecting the emulsion to sterilization. However, a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) of the emulsion was noticed when stored at 37°C. The higher is the storage temperature, the more is the liberation of free fatty acid from castor oil, resulting in the auto-alteration of the emulsion’s pH. At 4°C, it is interesting to see that the initial reduction of pH started only after 2 months, and even after its initiation, the progression in the reduction of pH was also not so rapid in the following months as compared to the higher storage temperatures. Thus, pH decreased only by one single unit.
------------------------------
Q: 15. Despite decreases in pH and zeta potential at higher temperatures, why was no significant droplet diameter increase observed in the emulsion?
A: No significant droplet diameter increase was observed because the mixed poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film provided robust stabilization through a combination of steric and electrostatic repulsive forces. Even with a decrease in zeta potential at higher temperatures, the remaining positive surface charge, coupled with the steric hindrance from poloxamer, was sufficient to prevent droplet coalescence and aggregation. Furthermore, the absence of significant changes in emulsion viscosity substantiated the integrity of the interfacial film.
Source: The combined implications of decreasing zeta potential and pH within the studied storage conditions in the absence of signiﬁcant droplet diameter increase could be explained on the basis of the mixed poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm and the observed high positive zeta potential value. Chitosan has a positive charge in acidic solutions due to the presence of protonated amino groups along its backbone that have pKa values between 6.3 and 7.0 (10,11). During emulsiﬁcation, chitosan molecules are localized at the interface and interca-lated between the nonionic surfactants. Hence, a mixed interfacial ﬁlm comprising the poloxamer and chitosan molecules was formed at the o/w interface which resulted in an overall positive surface charge (zeta potential). The high positive zeta potential value observed even after the higher storage temperatures was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions. Moreover, the combined steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsive forces were also operating onto the dispersed castor oil droplets to maintain the stability of the produced nano-sized particles. It should be added that the viscosity of the emulsion stored at three different temperatures did not show any signiﬁcant change (data not shown). This result further substantiates the interfacial properties of the chitosan along with poloxamer. Consequently, no signiﬁcant droplet diameter increase was noted in the emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 16. What were the effects of freeze–thaw cycling on the nano-sized emulsion in the absence of cryoprotectants, and what physicochemical mechanisms contributed to this instability?
A: In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the emulsion progressively increased from 243 nm to 480 nm after five freeze–thaw cycles, indicating extensive droplet aggregation. This instability is attributed to: 1) water crystallization confining oil droplets and reducing free water for hydration; 2) increased ionic strength in the freeze-concentrated aqueous phase; 3) disruption of interfacial membranes by ice crystals; and 4) partial coalescence caused by fat crystallization within the oil droplets.
Source: In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the emulsion was found to increase progressively from 243 to 480 nm after ﬁve cycles. A number of physicochemical mechanisms may be responsible for the extensive droplet aggregation observed in the absence of cryoprotectants. First, when the emulsion was placed in the freezer, some of its water crystallized. This caused the dispersed oil droplets to come into closer proximity because the oil droplets were conﬁned to the nonfrozen regions remaining in the aqueous phase (16). When there was no presence of sufﬁcient free water to fully hydrate the oil droplet surfaces (17– 19), the droplet– droplet interactions was forced closer together to effect coalescence to occur. Second, ice crystallization led to an increase in the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated non-frozen aqueous phase surrounding the emulsion droplets (18). Third, it is possible that ice crystals formed during freezing may have penetrated into the oil droplets and disrupted their interfacial membranes. This allowed the oil droplets more prone to coalescence between them. Fourth, cooling may have caused some of the fat in the emulsion droplets to crystallize promoting partial coalescence due to penetration of a fat crystal from one droplet through the membrane of another droplet (20,21).
------------------------------
Q: 17. How effective were the cryoprotectants (5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol) in stabilizing the nano-sized emulsion during freeze–thaw cycling?
A: The cryoprotectants, consisting of 5% w/w sucrose and 5% w/w sorbitol, were highly effective in stabilizing the nano-sized emulsion during freeze–thaw cycling. After one cycle, no significant change in mean droplet diameter was observed (remaining around 240 nm), and even after five cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased only marginally to 260 nm, demonstrating excellent protection against droplet aggregation.
Source: In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm), and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased to 260 nm only.
------------------------------
Q: 18. What are the proposed mechanisms by which cryoprotectants improve the stability of emulsions against aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling?
A: Cryoprotectants improve emulsion stability during freeze–thaw cycling primarily through two mechanisms: 1) by increasing the osmolyte concentration in the aqueous phase, they reduce the crystallization temperature, limit ice crystal formation, and increase the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets; and 2) they form hydrogen bonds with emulsifiers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, which reduces the tendency for destabilizing interactions between droplet surfaces when free water content is reduced by ice crystallization.
Source: A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the ability of cryoprotectants to improve the stability of emulsions to aggregation during freeze – thaw cycling. First, cryoprotectants increased the osmolyte concentra-tion in the aqueous phase, thereby reducing its crystal-lization temperature. Subsequently, the total amount of ice crystal formation was limited, and therefore, the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets was increased (18). Second, cryoprotectants formed hydrogen bonds with emulsiﬁers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency for interactions to occur between droplet surfaces when the free water content was reduced by ice crystallization (19).
------------------------------
Q: 19. What is the main conclusion regarding the stabilization effectiveness of the poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and the influence of storage on emulsion properties?
A: The main conclusion is that the poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film effectively stabilized the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion by maintaining its mean droplet diameter regardless of storage conditions. However, the emulsion’s zeta potential and pH were altered across all tested temperatures due to free fatty acid liberation. Additionally, the inclusion of cryoprotectants was essential for stabilizing the emulsion against droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling.
Source: Regardless of the storage conditions, the poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm was able to stabilize the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion in terms of mean droplet diameter. However, the emulsion’s zeta potential and pH were altered with storage at all temper-atures. The addition of cryoprotectants stabilized the emulsion against droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. Further works are undergoing in our lab to investigate the stability of the castor oil-based emulsion following incorporation of various active pharmaceutical ingredients that range in size from small molecular drugs (acetazolamide, azithromycin, and celecoxib) to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.
------------------------------
Q: 20. What are the planned future investigations for the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion system developed in this study?
A: Planned future investigations involve assessing the stability of the castor oil-based emulsion after incorporating various active pharmaceutical ingredients. These APIs span a wide range, from small molecular drugs such as acetazolamide, azithromycin, and celecoxib, to large macromolecules like oligonucleotides, to evaluate the system's versatility as a drug delivery vehicle.
