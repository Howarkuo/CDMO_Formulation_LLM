=== Part1 ANALYSIS ===
SUMMARY:
This study focuses on preparing a phospholipid-less, castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion with cationic droplets stabilized by a poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and assessing its kinetic stability. Key findings indicate that the mean droplet diameter remains stable for up to 6 months at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C. However, storage at 37°C led to a progressive decrease in emulsion pH and zeta potential, attributed to the liberation of free fatty acids from castor oil. The inclusion of a cryoprotectant mixture (5% sucrose + 5% sorbitol) significantly enhanced the emulsion's stability against droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. The stable cationic nano-emulsion system holds promise as a versatile drug delivery vehicle for various active pharmaceutical ingredients, from small molecules to large macromolecules, overcoming issues associated with phospholipid-based formulations.

Q: 1. What were the primary objectives of this research regarding the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion?

This aims to develop a stable emulsion system for pharmaceutical applications.

------------------------------
Q: 2. What are the main components of the phospholipid-less nano-sized emulsion developed in this study?
A: The main components of the phospholipid-less nano-sized emulsion are castor oil as the oil phase, poloxamer–chitosan as the emulgator system, and water as the aqueous component. This selection was made to avoid the stability issues associated with phospholipid-containing emulsions.
Source: Therefore, castor oil, poloxamer– chitosan, and water are being selected respectively as the model oil– emulgators– water components to prepare the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 3. How does the poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film stabilize the dispersed castor oil droplets in the nano-sized emulsion?
A: The poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film stabilizes the droplets through a combination of steric and electrostatic repulsions. Chitosan molecules, which are cationic due to protonated amino groups in acidic solutions, localize at the oil–water interface and intercalate between the nonionic poloxamer molecules, creating an overall positive surface charge (electrostatic repulsion) and a physical barrier (steric repulsion).
Source: By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion.
------------------------------
Q: 4. What are the recognized advantages of using a nano-sized emulsion system for drug delivery applications?
A: Nano-sized emulsion systems offer several advantages including natural biodegradability, a sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization capabilities in the oil phase or at the oil-water interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability. These properties make them promising drug delivery vehicles for parenteral and topical applications.
Source: The advantages of the nano-sized emulsion system include: natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization either at the innermost oil phase or at the o/w interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability (4). Due to these advantages, the nano-sized emulsion is now recognized as a promising drug delivery vehicle or carrier for parenteral (5) and topical (ocular and percutaneous) (5,6) applications.
------------------------------
Q: 5. What significant stability issue is associated with phospholipid-containing emulsions, particularly concerning pH and drug incorporation?
A: Phospholipid-containing emulsions are prone to the liberation of free fatty acids from phospholipid components, which generates a microclimate acidic pH in the oil phase, oil-water interface, and water phase of the emulsion. This acidic pH can be harmful to incorporated drug molecules, especially peptides or proteins, due to potential structural degradation or modification, making their incorporation questionable.
Source: However, even with the addition of antioxidants, the phospholipid-containing emulsion was prone to the liberation of free fatty acids (from phospholipid components), leading to the generation microclimate acidic pH in the vicinity of the oil phase, oil– water interface, and water phase of the emulsion (8,9). The microclimate pH thus generated might be harmful to the emulsion-incorporated drug mole – cules. Up to now, the adjustment of pH of the sterilized emulsion by adding mild alkali is the only viable option to prepare the emulsion with desired near neutral value (pH ≈7). If free fatty acid was released or mild alkali solution was added during the formulation of phospholipid-stabilized emulsion, then incorporation of peptide or protein into the emulsion might be questionable due to its possible structural degradation/modiﬁcation.
------------------------------
Q: 6. What role do cryoprotectants play in the stability of the nano-sized emulsion, particularly during freeze–thaw cycling?
A: Cryoprotectants significantly improve the stability of emulsions by preventing droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. For instance, an emulsion with 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol maintained its mean droplet diameter around 240 nm after one cycle, and only increased to 260 nm after five cycles, indicating enhanced resistance to size changes compared to formulations without cryoprotectants.
Source: In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm), and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased to 260 nm only.
------------------------------
Q: 7. How did storage temperature affect the mean droplet diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion over 6 months?
A: The mean droplet diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion showed no significant changes when stored at temperatures up to 37°C for a period of 6 months. This observation indicates that the emulsion maintained its physical stability and resistance to droplet aggregation or coalescence over the tested storage conditions.
Source: Up to 37°C, no signiﬁcant changes were noted in mean droplet diameter. This indicates that over this 6-month period, castor oil- based nano-sized emulsion remained physically stable.
------------------------------
Q: 8. What was the effect of different storage temperatures (4°C, 25°C, 37°C) on the zeta potential of the emulsion over 6 months?
A: The zeta potential of the emulsion decreased with increasing storage temperature over 6 months. Initially at +41.4 mV, it decreased to +30.6±1.37 mV at 37°C, +37.2±2.35 mV at 25°C, and remained relatively stable at +37.8±0.89 mV at 4°C. This indicates that lower temperatures are more adequate for maintaining the surface charge stability of the emulsified particles.
Source: However, depending on the storage temperatures, the zeta potential of the emulsion was found to decrease. Immediately after the preparation of fresh emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV (Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization at elevated temperature. Keeping the emulsion at 37°C for up to 6 months decreased the zeta potential to +30.6±1.37 mV. The same emulsion stored at 25°C showed a lesser reduction in the zeta potential (+37.2±2.35 mV). At 4°C, the zeta potential of the emulsion was still found to be +37.8±0.89 mV.
------------------------------
Q: 9. How did storage temperature influence the pH of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion over time?
A: The storage temperature significantly influenced the emulsion's pH. At 37°C, a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) was observed. At 25°C, pH also decreased but less significantly. Conversely, at 4°C, the pH reduction was minimal, starting only after 2 months and decreasing by only one unit over the entire period. This demonstrates that lower temperatures better preserve the emulsion's pH.
Source: The ﬁgure clearly shows the reduction of the emulsion’s pH at 25°C and 37°C. It should be noted that the initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0 using a mild acid before subjecting the emulsion to sterilization. However, a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) of the emulsion was noticed when stored at 37°C. The higher is the storage temperature, the more is the liberation of free fatty acid from castor oil, resulting in the auto-alteration of the emulsion’s pH. At 4°C, it is interesting to see that the initial reduction of pH started only after 2 months, and even after its initiation, the progression in the reduction of pH was also not so rapid in the following months as compared to the higher storage temperatures. Thus, pH decreased only by one single unit.
------------------------------
Q: 10. What is the underlying reason for the observed decrease in emulsion pH and zeta potential values at higher storage temperatures?
A: The decrease in emulsion pH and zeta potential values at higher storage temperatures, particularly at 37°C, is attributed to the formation and liberation of free fatty acids from the castor oil. These liberated fatty acids are acidic, causing a reduction in pH, and can interact with the positively charged chitosan, leading to a decrease in the overall positive zeta potential of the droplets.
Source: This indicates that at 37°C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values.
------------------------------
Q: 11. What was the initial zeta potential of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion, and what does its magnitude signify for emulsion stability?
A: The freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion had an initial zeta potential of approximately +41.4 mV. This high positive value is significant as it provides sufficient electrostatic repulsion between dispersed droplets, effectively preventing droplet coalescence upon random collisions and maintaining stability even after rigorous processes like autoclave sterilization at elevated temperatures.
Source: Immediately after the preparation of fresh emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV (Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization at elevated temperature.
------------------------------
Q: 12. What are the key mechanisms responsible for the kinetic stability of the phospholipid-less castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion, even after autoclave sterilization?
A: The kinetic stability of the emulsion is primarily due to a combination of steric repulsion from poloxamer and electrostatic repulsion from cationic chitosan at the oil-water interface. Additionally, after autoclave sterilization, liberated free fatty acids (like ricinoleic acid) from castor oil can interact with positively charged chitosan, acquiring mild emulsification properties that further contribute to stabilization.
Source: By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. Furthermore, the substantial stability shown by phospholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion even after autoclave sterilization could reasonably be attributed to the following explanation. Castor oil is known to contain traces of free fatty acid (recinoleic acid), and even some amount of fatty acid is likely to be liberated after autoclave sterilization. After interaction with positively charged chitosan, the negatively charged fatty acids might acquire mild emulsiﬁcation property (14).
------------------------------
Q: 13. Outline the key steps involved in the preparation of the phospholipid-less nano-sized emulsion.
A: The preparation involved heating castor oil with α-tocopherol, chitosan in acetic acid, and poloxamer 188 with glycerin in separate solutions to 70°C. These phases were then combined and stirred, heated to 85°C, followed by high shear mixing for 5 minutes and rapid cooling below 20°C. The crude emulsion was then homogenized at 9000 £/in.^2 for 5 minutes, filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane, packed under nitrogen, and sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 minutes.
Source: In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα- tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C. Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer. The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of 85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica, Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below 20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer, APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in. 2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then ﬁltered through a TE membrane ﬁlter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany) with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min.
------------------------------
Q: 14. Which alternative oils were tested and found unsuitable for creating a stable emulsion system with the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier combination in preliminary experiments?
A: In preliminary experiments, several alternative oils, including medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), soybean oil, sesame seed oil, cottonseed oil, and safflower oil, were tested but were unable to produce a stable emulsion system when combined with the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier.
Source: In our preliminary experiments, none of the aforementioned oils is able to produce a stable emulsion system when poloxamer– chitosan emulsiﬁer combination is used. Previous literature references show that using corn oil as the oil phase and lecithin– chitosan as the emulsiﬁer combination resulted in a stable emulsion system (10,11).
------------------------------
Q: 15. What was the impact of five freeze–thaw cycles on the mean particle diameter of the nano-sized emulsion when cryoprotectants were absent?
A: In the absence of cryoprotectants, five freeze–thaw cycles caused a progressive increase in the mean particle diameter of the nano-sized emulsion, from an initial 243 nm to 480 nm. This indicates significant droplet aggregation and instability under these conditions.
Source: Dependence of mean particle diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion on the number of freeze– thaw cycles (−10°C for 22 h/30°C for 2 h) in the absence and presence of cryoprotectants is depicted in Fig. 2. In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the emulsion was found to increase progressively from 243 to 480 nm after ﬁve cycles.
------------------------------
Q: 16. What was the observed improvement in emulsion stability against freeze–thaw cycling when specific cryoprotectants were included?
A: The inclusion of cryoprotectants, specifically 5% w/w sucrose and 5% w/w sorbitol, significantly improved emulsion stability during freeze–thaw cycling. The mean droplet diameter remained around 240 nm after one cycle and only increased slightly to 260 nm after five cycles, demonstrating effective protection against aggregation.
Source: In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm), and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased to 260 nm only.
------------------------------
Q: 17. Describe the physicochemical mechanisms leading to extensive droplet aggregation in emulsions during freeze–thaw cycling without cryoprotectants.
A: Several mechanisms contribute to instability: 1) Water crystallization concentrates oil droplets into non-frozen regions, forcing them into closer proximity and promoting coalescence due to insufficient hydration of droplet surfaces. 2) Ice crystallization increases the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated aqueous phase, reducing electrostatic repulsion. 3) Ice crystals may penetrate and disrupt interfacial membranes, making droplets more prone to coalescence. 4) Fat crystallization within emulsion droplets can promote partial coalescence through crystal penetration of membranes.
Source: A number of physicochemical mechanisms may be responsible for the extensive droplet aggregation observed in the absence of cryoprotectants. First, when the emulsion was placed in the freezer, some of its water crystallized. This caused the dispersed oil droplets to come into closer proximity because the oil droplets were conﬁned to the nonfrozen regions remaining in the aqueous phase (16). When there was no presence of sufﬁcient free water to fully hydrate the oil droplet surfaces (17– 19), the droplet– droplet interactions was forced closer together to effect coalescence to occur. Second, ice crystallization led to an increase in the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated non-frozen aqueous phase surrounding the emulsion droplets (18). Third, it is possible that ice crystals formed during freezing may have penetrated into the oil droplets and disrupted their interfacial membranes. This allowed the oil droplets more prone to coalescence between them. Fourth, cooling may have caused some of the fat in the emulsion droplets to crystallize promoting partial coalescence due to penetration of a fat crystal from one droplet through the membrane of another droplet (20,21).
------------------------------
Q: 18. Explain the proposed mechanisms by which cryoprotectants enhance the stability of emulsions against aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling.
A: Cryoprotectants enhance stability through two main mechanisms: Firstly, they increase the osmolyte concentration in the aqueous phase, lowering its crystallization temperature, which limits ice crystal formation and maintains a larger volume of non-frozen aqueous phase around oil droplets. Secondly, cryoprotectants form hydrogen bonds with emulsifiers on droplet surfaces, which reduces droplet-droplet interactions even when free water content is diminished by ice crystallization.
Source: A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the ability of cryoprotectants to improve the stability of emulsions to aggregation during freeze – thaw cycling. First, cryoprotectants increased the osmolyte concen – tration in the aqueous phase, thereby reducing its crystal – lization temperature. Subsequently, the total amount of ice crystal formation was limited, and therefore, the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets was increased (18). Second, cryoprotectants formed hydrogen bonds with emulsiﬁers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency for interactions to occur between droplet surfaces when the free water content was reduced by ice crystallization (19).
------------------------------
Q: 19. What range of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is the developed injectable nano-sized emulsion capable of incorporating, according to the study?
A: The developed injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion is capable of incorporating a wide range of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including small molecular drugs such as acetazolamide, azithromycin, and celecoxib, as well as large macromolecules like oligonucleotides. This versatility makes it a promising drug delivery platform.
Source: Thus, the injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion could be useful for incorporating various active pharmaceutical ingredients that are in size from small molecular drugs to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides. Further works are undergoing in our lab to investigate the stability of the castor oil-based emulsion following incorporation of various active pharmaceutical ingredients that range in size from small molecular drugs (acetazolamide, azithromycin, and celecoxib) to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.
------------------------------
Q: 20. What potential challenges might arise in scaling up the manufacturing process of this nano-sized emulsion based on the described methodology?
A: Scaling up this manufacturing process could face challenges such as ensuring consistent heating and cooling rates for larger volumes, maintaining uniform mixing and shear forces across larger batches during high shear mixing and two-stage homogenization to achieve the desired nano-sized droplet distribution, and managing the precise temperature control required for the different phases. Additionally, sterilization by autoclave for large-scale batches might impact product integrity or require validation for consistent sterility and stability.
Source: In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα- tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C. Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer. The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of 85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica, Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below 20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer, APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in. 2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then ﬁltered through a TE membrane ﬁlter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany) with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. In total, nine replicate emulsion samples were prepared using the same ingredients with identical experimental conditions.
