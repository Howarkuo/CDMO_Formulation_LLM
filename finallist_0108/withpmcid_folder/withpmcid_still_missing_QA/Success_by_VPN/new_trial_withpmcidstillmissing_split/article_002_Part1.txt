=== Part1 ANALYSIS ===
SUMMARY:
This study aimed to enhance the intestinal absorption of phytoestrogenic diarylheptanoids (DA1 and DA2) from Curcuma comosa, which are characterized by their lipophilic nature and poor water solubility. The compounds were formulated into oil-in-water nanoemulsions using a two-step homogenization method with nonionic surfactants (Tween 60 and cetomacrogol 1000) and olive oil. The nanoemulsions exhibited uniform particle sizes (0.207-0.408 μm) and slightly negative zeta potentials (-10.47 to -14.57 mV), along with high entrapment efficiencies (71.63-76.61%). Crucially, in situ intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were increased by five to ten times in nanoemulsion formulations compared to conventional oil-based formulations, confirming the efficacy of nanoemulsification as a strategy to improve systemic delivery of poorly soluble herbal extracts.

========================================

Q: 1. What was the primary conclusion of the study regarding the formulation of diarylheptanoids?
A: The primary conclusion was that the formulation in nanoemulsion forms obviously increased the intestinal absorption rate of diarylheptanoids. This indicates that nanoemulsification is an effective strategy for improving the systemic delivery of these compounds.
Source: In conclusion, the formulation in nanoemulsion forms obviously increased the intestinal absorption rate of diarylheptanoids.
------------------------------
Q: 2. How much faster were the intestinal absorption rates of diarylheptanoids when formulated in nanoemulsions compared to oil-based formulations?
A: The intestinal absorption rates of diarylheptanoids in nanoemulsions were five to ten times faster than when they were formulated in oil. For instance, DA1 absorption in C.c-Nano was 0.329±0.015 μg/min/cm², significantly higher than C.c-oil's 0.031±0.003 μg/min/cm².
Source: The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which were five to ten times faster than those in oil.
------------------------------
Q: 3. What are the two major diarylheptanoid compounds from Curcuma comosa identified in this study, and what is their critical physicochemical property relevant to formulation?
A: The two major diarylheptanoid compounds are (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2). Their critical physicochemical property relevant to formulation is their lipophilic nature and poor water solubility, indicated by logP values of 4.36 for DA1 and 4.87 for DA2, which necessitated an appropriate formulation for systemic delivery.
Source: Recently, several diarylheptanoids had been purified fromC. comosaextract, and their pharmacological effects were reported. Two specific molecules, (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2) (Fig.1), were reported as the major compounds, which comprised 16.02% and 30.66% of the crude extract, respectively (11). The C. comosa hexane extract and the two diarylheptanoids are lipophilic. Using XLOGP3 software (13) calculation, the logP values of DA1 and DA2 are 4.36 and 4.87, respectively. The poor water solubility of these diarylheptanoids was of concern when considering an appropriate formulation for sufficient systemic delivery of these active phytoestrogens.
------------------------------
Q: 4. Describe the two-step method used for preparing the oil-in-water nanoemulsions in this study.
A: The oil-in-water nanoemulsions were prepared using a co-surfactant method in two steps. First, a premix was formed by adding the water phase (75°C) to a warm oil phase (70°C) containing nonionic surfactants and olive oil, with C. comosa extract or DA1/DA2, and mixing with a magnetic stirrer for 10 minutes, followed by homogenization at 2,000 rpm for 20 minutes using a homomixer. Second, this pre-emulsion was passed through a high-pressure homogenizer at 10,000 psi for five cycles to achieve nanosized droplets.
Source: The oil-in-water nanoemulsion was prepared in two steps using a co-surfactant method. The oil phase consisted of two nonionic surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or Tween 60, and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 or cetomacrogol 1000) and olive oil (TableI). C. comosaextract or the mixture of DA1 and DA2 were separately added to the warm oil phase at 70°C and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer. The water phase (75°C) was then added to form the premix. After homogenization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five cycles to yield the nanoemulsions.
------------------------------
Q: 5. Which nonionic surfactants were utilized in the nanoemulsion formulations, and why were they chosen?
A: Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 (cetomacrogol 1000) were utilized as nonionic surfactants. They were chosen based on their established safety and compatibility in pharmaceutical products, with the amounts in the formulation being well below their respective LD50 values.
Source: Both Tween 60 and cetomacrogol 1000 are nonionic surfactants that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical products based on their safety and compatibility. The amounts of these compounds in the formulation were under their LD50 values (60 mL/kg and 2–4 g/kg, respectively) (23). Olive oil was used due to its ability to solubilize diarylheptanoids.
------------------------------
Q: 6. What were the mean particle sizes and zeta potentials for the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations?
A: The mean particle size for C.c-Nano was 0.207±0.001 μm, and for DA-Nano, it was 0.408±0.014 μm. Both emulsions exhibited slightly negative zeta potentials, with C.c-Nano at −14.57±0.85 mV and DA-Nano at −10.47±0.32 mV.
Source: The particle size distributions of the nanoemulsions were uniform with mean values of 0.207±0.001 and 0.408±0.014μm for the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations, respectively (Table III, Fig.4). The entrapment efficiencies and drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 in the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano emulsions as well as the zeta potential of the nanoemulsions are reported in Table IV. These results showed that the entrapment efficiencies for DA1 and DA2 were similar for both nanoemulsions, but that the drug loading of these compounds was greater for the C.c-Nano emulsion. Both emulsions exhibited slightly negative zeta potentials.
------------------------------
Q: 7. What were the entrapment efficiencies (%EE) and drug loading ratios (μg/mg) for DA1 and DA2 in both C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations?
A: For C.c-Nano, the entrapment efficiencies were 76.61% for DA1 and 75.41% for DA2, with drug loading ratios of 351.47 μg/mg for DA1 and 614.53 μg/mg for DA2. For DA-Nano, the entrapment efficiencies were 71.91% for DA1 and 71.63% for DA2, with drug loading ratios of 59.48 μg/mg for DA1 and 126.72 μg/mg for DA2.
Source: The entrapments of DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respectively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano.
------------------------------
Q: 8. What is the proposed mechanism by which nanoemulsions improve the intestinal absorption of lipophilic compounds like diarylheptanoids?
A: The proposed mechanism for improved intestinal absorption by nanoemulsions is primarily attributed to their smaller droplet sizes, which significantly increase the surface area available for drug absorption. Additionally, the presence of surfactants in the formulation may facilitate the access of the lipophilic compounds to the intestinal mucosa.
Source: The improvement in the absorption of the nanoemulsion was evidently due to the smaller droplet sizes and the presence of surfactants which might aid access of the lipophilic compounds to the intestine mucosa.
------------------------------
Q: 9. What was a significant formulation failure observed during the preliminary stages of this study, and why was it problematic?
A: A significant formulation failure was observed with conventional emulsions of the C. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids, which had a mean particle size of 14–16 μm. These emulsions were not stable, exhibiting phase separation within 1 hour, which rendered them unsuitable for performing absorption tests.
Source: The C. comosa extract and DAs were stable in their oil solution. However, their conventional emulsions with a mean particle size of 14–16 μm were not stable with phase separation evident within 1 h, so that an absorption test could not be performed.
------------------------------
Q: 10. How was the physical stability of the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations assessed?
A: The physical stability of the nanoemulsion formulations was assessed by monitoring their mean particle sizes. When stored at 4°C, the mean particle sizes of C.c-Nano (0.208±0.001 μm) and DA-Nano (0.414±0.002 μm) remained unchanged at 14 days. Furthermore, the formulations showed no alterations in their physical appearance after being stored for up to 3 months.
Source: When stored at 4°C, these two formulations were stable as it was observed that their mean particle sizes were not changed (0.208±0.001 and 0.414±0.002μm, respectively). The stability of the nanoemulsion was much greater while the particle size of both C.c-nano and DA-nano formulations did not change as observed at 14 days. Moreover, after keeping the formulations up to 3 months, there were no changes in their physical appearance.
------------------------------
Q: 11. What specific high-pressure homogenization parameters were employed during the nanoemulsion preparation, and why are these relevant for scale-up?
A: The pre-emulsion was subjected to high-pressure homogenization at 10,000 psi for five cycles. These parameters are crucial for achieving the desired nano-sized droplets and maintaining batch-to-batch consistency, which are critical considerations for successful scale-up of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.
Source: After homogenization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five cycles to yield the nanoemulsions.
------------------------------
Q: 12. What critical further studies are required to fully assess the clinical potential of diarylheptanoids formulated in nanoemulsions?
A: To fully assess the clinical potential, further studies are required to demonstrate greater bioavailability, investigate the metabolite pattern of diarylheptanoids (considering first-pass liver metabolism and post-hepatic enzymes), and conduct comprehensive pharmacological and toxicological studies of the C. comosa extract and purified diarylheptanoids formulated in nanoemulsions.
Source: Although higher absorption rates of diarylheptanoids were observed when formulated in nanoemulsions, a demonstration of greater bioavailability needed to be obtained. After the active compounds were absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, their concentrations in blood were also dependent on the first pass liver metabolism as well as by post-hepatic enzymes. Further study on the metabolite pattern of the diarylheptanoids is essential. Nanoemulsions may also induce changes in the absorption pattern of the other compounds included in the crude extract. Thus, pharmacological and toxicological studies ofC. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids formulated in nanoemulsions are also required.
------------------------------
Q: 13. Compare the in situ intestinal absorption rate of DA1 from C.c-Nano versus C.c-oil.
A: The in situ intestinal absorption rate of DA1 from the C.c-Nano formulation was 0.329±0.015 μg/min/cm². In contrast, the absorption rate of DA1 from the C.c-oil formulation was considerably lower at 0.031±0.003 μg/min/cm², demonstrating a significant enhancement by nanoemulsification.
Source: The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which were five to ten times faster than those in oil.  Table V. In Situ Intestinal Absorption Rates of DA1 and DA2 in Four Formulations: C.c-oil 0.031±0.003, C.c-Nano 0.329±0.015.
------------------------------
Q: 14. Compare the in situ intestinal absorption rate of DA2 from C.c-Nano versus C.c-oil.
A: The in situ intestinal absorption rate of DA2 from the C.c-Nano formulation was 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm². This is substantially higher than the absorption rate of DA2 from the C.c-oil formulation, which was 0.109±0.022 μg/min/cm², highlighting the significant improvement with the nanoemulsion.
Source: The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and 0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which were five to ten times faster than those in oil.  Table V. In Situ Intestinal Absorption Rates of DA1 and DA2 in Four Formulations: C.c-oil 0.109±0.022, C.c-Nano 0.519±0.026.
------------------------------
Q: 15. Why was the particle size of DA-Nano observed to be approximately twofold larger than that of C.c-Nano, despite using similar preparation methods?
A: The particle size of DA-Nano (0.408 ± 0.014 μm) was about twofold larger than C.c-Nano (0.207 ± 0.001 μm) because the crude extract used in C.c-Nano contained more components than just the two purified compounds in DA-Nano. These additional components likely acted as co-surfactants, partitioning into the interface, reducing interfacial energy, and thereby facilitating the formation of smaller droplets.
Source: It is noticed that the particle size of DA-Nano was twofold larger than that of the C.c-Nano emulsion (Table III). This might be because the crude extract contained more components than just two purified compounds. These components might function as co-surfactants, which were initially partitioned into the interface, reducing the energy of the interface and removing the hydrophobic parts of the surfactant from contacts with water, finally resulting in the smaller particle size of crude extract formulation than that containing of DA1 and DA2 (25).
------------------------------
Q: 16. How did the difference in particle size between C.c-Nano and DA-Nano differentially affect the absorption of DA1 and DA2?
A: The smaller particle size of C.c-Nano (0.207 μm) resulted in an increased absorption of DA2 (0.519 μg/min/cm²) compared to DA-Nano (0.408 μm, 0.428 μg/min/cm²), but it did not similarly increase the absorption of DA1. The exact reason for this differential effect on DA1 and DA2 absorption was not identified but indicated that particle size effects on absorption can be compound-specific.
Source: More interestingly, the smaller particle size resulted in the increased absorption of DA2 but not of DA1 (Fig. 5). The reason was unknown, but it provided the information of how particle sizes affect the absorption of DA1 and DA2.
------------------------------
Q: 17. What nonabsorbable marker was used in the in situ intestinal absorption study to monitor for physical leakage?
A: Phenol red, at a concentration of 30 μg/mL, was used as a nonabsorbable marker in the blank nanoemulsion during the in situ intestinal perfusion study. Its consistent concentration in the perfusate confirmed the absence of physical leakage or tight-junction damage, ensuring that observed absorption was not due to non-specific permeability.
Source: After in situintestinal perfusion of the blank nanoemulsion containing phenol red marker, the obtained perfusate showed no leakage of phenol red as it was observed that the concentrations of phenol red were not changed from the original blank nanoemulsion. The blank nanoemulsion (without the plant extract) containing a nonabsorbable marker, phenol red, at a concentration of 30 μg/mL was also tested as the control group (22).
------------------------------
Q: 18. What are the traditional uses and reported pharmacological effects of Curcuma comosa, which motivated its study?
A: Curcuma comosa has been widely used in Southeast Asia for gynecological conditions such as uterine inflammation, postpartum uterine bleeding, and premenopausal bleeding, as well as an aromatic stomachic. Its hexane extract has reported pharmacological effects including estrogenic-like functions, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, hypolipidemic effects, and memory improvement, motivating its further study for therapeutic applications.
Source: The medicinal plantCurcuma comosaRoxb. (Zingiberaceae) has been widely used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of uterine inflammation, postpartum uterinebleeding, premenopausal bleed-ing, and as an aromatic stomachic. The pharmacological effects of its hexane extract have been reported including its estrogenic-like functions (1–3), anti-inflammatory effects (4), choleretic activities (5,6), hypolipidemic effects (7,8), and memory improvement (9,10).
------------------------------
Q: 19. What were the reported bioavailabilities of DA1 and DA2 when the C. comosa extract was diluted in olive oil and administered orally?
A: When the C. comosa extract was diluted in olive oil and administered orally, the reported bioavailability for DA1 was 24.01%, and for DA2, it was 34.56%. Increasing the administered dose resulted in a greater maximum blood concentration but lower overall bioavailability, likely due to a slower absorption process.
Source: The pharmacokinetic profiles of DA1 and DA2 were also studied in animals (11). TheC. comosaextract that had been diluted in olive oil was shown to have bioavailability of 24.01% and 34.56% for DA1 and DA2, respectively, after oral administration. Although increasing the administrated dose resulted in a greater maximum blood concentration, lower bioavailability was observed most likely due to the slower absorption process.
------------------------------
Q: 20. What were the specific HPLC detection wavelengths and retention times used for DA1 and DA2 analysis in this study?
A: For DA1 analysis, the detected wavelength was 302 nm, and its retention time was 16.35 min. For DA2 analysis, the detected wavelength was 250 nm, and its retention time was 13.29 min.
Source: An Agilent LC 1200 HPLC system was used with mobile phase consisting of 35% ofn-hexane and 65% of dichloromethane. A Hypersil silica column (250 mm×4.6 mm, 5μm, Thermo®)w a s used, and the column temperature was set at 25°C. The flow rate was maintained at 1.5 mL/min, and the detected wavelengths were 302 nm for DA1 and 250 nm for DA2. This HPLC assay was able to achieve a good separation of DA1 and DA2 with retention times of 16.35 and 13.29 min when detected at the wavelength of 302 and 250 nm, respectively (Figs.2c–f and 3c–f).
