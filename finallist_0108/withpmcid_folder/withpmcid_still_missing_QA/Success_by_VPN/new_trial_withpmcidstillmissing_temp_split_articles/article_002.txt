Abstract. Curcuma comosahas long been used as a gynecological medicine. Several diarylheptanoids have
been purified from this plant, and their pharmacological effects were proven. However, there is no
information about the absorption ofC. comosa components to support the formulation usage. In the
present study, C. comosa hexane extract and the mixture of its two major compounds, (4E,6E)-1,7-
diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2), were formulated into
nanoemulsions. The physical properties of the nanoemulsions and thein situ intestinal absorptions of
DA1 and DA2 were evaluated. The results demonstrated the mean particle sizes at 0.207±0.001 and 0.408
±0.014 μm, and the zeta potential at−14.57±0.85 and−10.47±0.32 mV forC. comosananoemulsion (C.c-
Nano) and mixture of diarlylheptanoid nanoemulsions (DA-Nano), respectively. The entrapments of
DA1 and DA2 were 76.61% and 75.41%, and 71.91% and 71.63% for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano, respec-
tively. The drug loading ratios of DA1 and DA2 were 351.47 and 614.53μg/mg, and 59.48 and 126.72μg/
mg for C.c-Nano and DA-Nano. The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 were 0.329±0.015 and
0.519±0.026 μg/min/cm
2 in C.c-Nano, and 0.380±0.006 and 0.428±0.036μg/min/cm2 in DA-Nano, which
were five to ten times faster than those in oil. In conclusion, the formulation in nanoemulsion forms
obviously increased the intestinal absorption rate of diarylheptanoids.

INTRODUCTION
The medicinal plantCurcuma comosaRoxb. (Zingiberaceae)
has been widely used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of uterine
inflammation, postpartum uterinebleeding, premenopausal bleed-
ing, and as an aromatic stomachic. The pharmacological effects of
its hexane extract have been reported including its estrogenic-like
functions (1–3), anti-inflammatory effects (4), choleretic activities
(5,6), hypolipidemic effects (7,8), and memory improvement (9,10).
Among many traditional herbs in Thailand, the formulations of
herbal medicines containingC. comosaare popular in the market
for gynecological conditions. However, all clinical reports related to
C. comosaare empirical, and no information on the absorption
from different formulations has been reported. Recently, several
diarylheptanoids had been purified fromC. comosaextract, and
their pharmacological effects were reported. Two specific mole-
cules, (4E,6E)-1,7-diphenylhepta-4,6-dien-3-ol (DA1) and (6E)-
1,7-diphenylhept-6-en-3-ol (DA2) (Fig.1), were reported as the
major compounds, which comprised 16.02% and 30.66% of the
crude extract, respectively (11). The estrogenic effect of these two
diarylheptanoids was demonstrated in cell culture studies; thus,
these compounds were consideredas potential phytoestrogens
(12).
The pharmacokinetic profiles of DA1 and DA2 were also
studied in animals (11). TheC. comosaextract that had been
diluted in olive oil was shown to have bioavailability of
24.01% and 34.56% for DA1 and DA2, respectively, after oral
administration. Although increasing the administrated dose
resulted in a greater maximum blood concentration, lower
bioavailability was observed most likely due to the slower
absorption process. The C. comosa hexane extract and the
two diarylheptanoids are lipophilic. Using XLOGP3 software
(13) calculation, the logP values of DA1 and DA2 are 4.36
and 4.87, respectively. The poor water solubility of these
diarylheptanoids was of concern when considering an appro-
priate formulation for sufficient systemic delivery of these
active phytoestrogens.
Nanotechnology has been widely used in the development
of formulations of poorly soluble compounds. Nanoemulsions
usually have droplet sizes at the scale of nanometers, and these
can provide increased apparent water solubility, thermal stabil-
ity, and bioavailability, consequently resulting in improved phar-
macological effects. The benefit of nanoemulsions has been
demonstrated with herbal products such as curcumin (14,15),
St. John's wort extract (16), andKaempferia parvifloraextract
(17). Moreover, nanoemulsions offer the potential to significant-
ly improve the stability and bioavailability of certain carotenoids
such as beta-carotene and astaxanthin (18–
20). The main pur-
pose of the present study was to determine an improvement in

the intestinal absorption ofC. comosaand the diarylheptanoids
when formulated as a nanoemulsion. The related physical charac-
teristics ofC. comosaextract and diarylheptanoids nanoemulsions
were studied, and thein situintestinal absorption of the formula-
tions was evaluated in a commonly used animal model (21,22).
This is a preliminary study to test for the possibility to usein situ
intestinal absorption in rats for measuring the absorption of active
compounds of theC. comosacrude extract. The result provides
simultaneous absorption statusof the mixture of active compounds
in C. comosa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Animals
Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60),
polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 (cetomacrogol 1000), and sodium
chloride were obtained from Asia Pacific Specialty Chemicals
Limited (Australia). Hexane and dichloromethane (HPLC
grade) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (UK). Olive oil
(Sabroso
®, Spain) was obtained from a local vendor. Phenol
red was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA).
Female Wistar rats (8 weeks) were obtained from the
National Animal Center, Mahidol University, Bangkok. The
rats were housed in a room with a controlled temperature of
25±2°C and 12-h dark/light cycles. Standard food (C.P. Ltd.;
code, 082) and water were suppliedad libitum. The experi-
ments were conducted under the National Institute of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publications no. 80-23) revised in 1996 and approved by the
Ethics Committee on Animal Care and Use of Khon Kaen
University.
Plant Extract and the Purified Compounds
C. comosa rhizome was harvested from Nakon Pathom
province, Thailand (identified and provided by Professor
Pawinee Piyachaturawat at Mahidol University, Thailand). A
voucher specimen was filed and kept in our laboratory (BS-C-
03). C. comosa hexane extract was prepared before the ab-
sorption test following our previous report (9). Briefly, dried
samples of C. comosa were mashed to a crude powder and
subsequently extracted inn-hexane using a Soxhlet apparatus
until the outlet hexane was colorless. The hexane fraction was
then evaporated to obtain a brown–yellow oily extract which
was kept at 4°C until use. DA1 and DA2 (>98% purified)
were kindly provided by Professor Apichart Suksamrarn at
Ramkhamhaeng University, Thailand. DA1 and DA2 were
used to standardize the crude extract, in which the concentra-
tion of DA1 and DA2 were 153 and 313 mg/g, respectively. A
HPLC test was run to make sure the extract was stable during
the storage.
HPLC Method Validation and Analysis
An Agilent LC 1200 HPLC system was used with mobile
phase consisting of 35% ofn-hexane and 65% of dichloromethane.
A Hypersil silica column (250 mm×4.6 mm, 5μm, Thermo
®)w a s
used, and the column temperature was set at 25°C. The
flow rate was maintained at 1.5 mL/min, and the detected
wavelengths were 302 nm for DA1 and 250 nm for DA2.
To prepare the standard refe rences, these two purified
diarylheptanoids were separately dissolved in mobile phase to
prepare a five-gradient concentration of 0.25, 0.05, 0.01, 0.002,
and 0.0004 mg/mL followed by the HPLC analysis. Correlation
coefficients (r
2) were subsequently obtained by linear regression
analysis. Inter-day and intra-day precisions were analyzed; the
peak areas of DA1 and DA2 were used for calculating
the coefficient of variation (percent CV). Accuracy and
recovery of the DA1 and DA2 in different solutions were
also evaluated.
For HPLC analysis, the sample was extracted by hex-
ane via vigorous shaking and ultrasonication for 10 min,
followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000×g. The up-
per liquid layer in the centrifuge tube was transferred to
an evaporator dish and dried at room temperature. This
extraction process was repeated in triplicate. The residue
in the evaporator dish was redissolved in 500 μLo fm o -
bile phase for HPLC analysis.
Preparation of Nanoemulations
The oil-in-water nanoemulsion was prepared in two steps
using a co-surfactant method. The oil phase consisted of two
nonionic surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or
Tween 60, and polyoxyethylene glycol 1000 or cetomacrogol
1000) and olive oil (TableI). C. comosaextract or the mixture
of DA1 and DA2 were separately added to the warm oil phase
at 70°C and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer. The water
phase (75°C) was then added to form the premix. After homog-
enization using a homomixer (CKL, Selangor, Malaysia) at a
speed of 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the pre-emulsion was passed
through a high-pressure homogenizer (M-110P, Microfluidics
Corporation, Newton, MA, USA) at 10,000 psi for five
cycles to yield the nanoemulsions. The final concentration ofC.
comosaextract nanoemulsion (C.c-Nano) was 0.83 mg/mL, which
contained DA1 and DA2 at concentrations of 0.13 and 0.26 mg/
mL, respectively. The same concentrations of DA1 and DA2
were prepared in the diarylheptanoid mixture nanoemulsion
(DA-Nano).

Preparation ofC. comosaExtract and Mixture of Diarylheptanoid
in Olive Oil
The C. comosa extract was diluted in olive oil to a
concentration of 0.83 mg/mL to produce the C. comosa–
oil solution (C.c-oil). A mixt ure of the diarylheptanoids
was prepared by dissolving DA1 and DA2 in olive oil to
obtain the solution DA-oil containing 0.13 and 0.26 mg/
mL of DA1 and DA2, respectively. All of these four
formulations were tested by HPLC to make sure they
were stable at 37°C for 24 h.
Particle Size and Zeta Potential
The particle sizes of nanoemulsions were determined by
photon correlation spectroscopy using a Mastersizer (version
5.22, Malvern
® Instruments, UK). The zeta potentials of the
nanoemulsions were measured using a Zetasizer (Nano Z,
Malvern
® Instruments, UK).
Morphology of the Nanoemulsions
The morphologies of the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano
nanoemulsions were obtained by using a scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi ® model S-3000N, Tokyo, Japan).
Briefly, a drop of a freshly prepared formulation was directly
applied on the holey film grid followed by drying at room
temperature overnight. The sample was coated with gold for
20 min using an ion sputtering device before the scanning.
Entrapment Efficiency and Drug Loading Ratio of Nanoemulsions
Entrapment efficiency and drug loading ratio of the
nanoemulsions were determined using a centrifugal filtra-
tion device (Microcon
® Milllipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
fitted with a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter. Two
hundred microliters of the nanoemulsion was added to the
sample reservoir of the Microcon ® system and then
centrifuged at 1,500× g for 45 min at 4°C to separate
the entrapped and unentrapped contents. The sample
reservoir was washed twice with 100 μLo fd e i o n i z e d
water and was followed by collection of the entire
filtrate. The diarylheptanoi ds entrapped on the filter as
well as the unentrapped drug in the filtrate were analyzed
by HPLC. The entrapment efficiency (percent EE) and
drug loading ratio (DL ratio) were calculated using the
following equations:
%EE ¼

DL ratio ¼ entrapped diarylheptanoids μgðÞ

In SituAbsorption Study
All animals were fasted 24 h before the initiation of the
experiments and were allowed waterad libitum. Twelve ani-
mals were randomly separated into four groups (n=3) and
administered the four formulations, including C.c-Nano, DA-
Nano, C.c-oil, and DA-oil. The animals were anesthetized
under ether and then positioned on the operation stage in
supine position. Ether was carefully supplied by observing
the respiration of the animals to make sure of the anesthetic
status. A 5-cm incision was made in the abdomen to expose
the intestines. Two incisions were made in the small intes-
tine; a sterile influent tube was inserted in the proximal
end, and an effluent tube was connected to the distal end,
both of which were ligated to prevent leakage. After
washing out the intestinal contents with normal saline at
37°C, the drug-containing sample at 37°C from a sample
pool was pumped through the intestine at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/min, and the effluent was recycled into the sample
pool. After achieving a constant flow rate, 200 μLo f
solution was collected from the sample pool at every
10 min for 1 h. The effluent volume of each collected
sample was measured and used for compensating the vol-
ume absorbed by the intestine. After all samples had been
collected, the animals were sacrificed by ether overdose.
The surface area of the small intestine segment used in
the perfusion study was measured. The final absorption
rates of the two diarylheptanoids were expressed as mi-
crogram per minute per square centimeter. All perfusion
studies in rats were performed in triplicate for each for-
mulation. The blank nanoemulsion (without the plant ex-
tract) containing a nonabsorbable marker, phenol red, at a

RESULTS
HPLC Validation
This HPLC assay was able to achieve a good separation
of DA1 and DA2 with retention times of 16.35 and 13.29 min
when detected at the wavelength of 302 and 250 nm, respec-
tively (Figs.2c–f and 3c–f). The correlation coefficients of all
calibration curves of these two compounds showed good line-
arity (r
2>0.999) over the test range. The percent coefficient of
variation (%CV) of the method precision and accuracy were
less than 0.75 and 0.77, respectively; these values were 1.39
and 1.13 for intra- and inter-day assays, respectively. The limit of
detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of both
DA1 and DA2 were 0.0001 and 0.0003 mg/mL, respectively. The
average recovery was 96.8% for DA1 and 98.7% for DA2
(TableII). The after-perfused blank oil and nanoemulsion did not
interfere with the detection of DA1 and DA2 under the current
conditions (Figs.2a, band 3a, b). The results indicated that the
analytical method was reliable and reproducible.

1059Increased In SituIntestinal Absorption of Diarylheptanoids
Physical Characteristics of the Nanoemulsions
The particle size distributions of the nanoemulsions were
uniform with mean values of 0.207±0.001 and 0.408±0.014μm
for the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano formulations, respectively
(Table III, Fig.4). When stored at 4°C, these two formulations
were stable as it was observed that their mean particle sizes
were not changed (0.208±0.001 and 0.414±0.002μm, respec-
tively). The entrapment efficiencies and drug loading ratios of
DA1 and DA2 in the C.c-Nano and DA-Nano emulsions as
well as the zeta potential of the nanoemulsions are reported in
Table IV. These results showed that the entrapment efficien-
cies for DA1 and DA2 were similar for both nanoemulsions,
but that the drug loading of these compounds was greater for
the C.c-Nano emulsion. Both emulsions exhibited slightly
negative zeta potentials.
In SituIntestinal Absorption
After in situintestinal perfusion of the blank nanoemulsion
containing phenol red marker, the obtained perfusate showed
no leakage of phenol red as it was observed that the concentra-
tions of phenol red were not changed from the original blank
nanoemulsion. The intestinal absorption rates of DA1 and DA2
from different formulations as shown in TableV demonstrated
that the absorption of DA1 and DA2 in the nanoemulsions was
more rapid than when they were formulated in oils. The absorp-
tion of DA2 when administered in the C.c-Nano emulsion was
notably faster than when formulated in the DA-Nano emulsion.
Compared to the formulation in oils, the concentrations of DA1
and DA2 in the sample pool of the formulation in
nanoemulsions decreased more rapidly (Fig.5). This is another
indication that DA1 and DA2 were more rapidly absorbed
when formulated in nanoemulsions.
DISCUSSION
Many in vitrostudies have been conducted on the pharma-
cological activity of compounds that have been isolated and
purified from plants. However, further development of most of
these compounds has been aborted because effective blood
concentrations could not be attained, primarily due to their
physical–chemical properties such as solubility, partition coeffi-
cient, lipophilicity, and crystallinity. In the present study, the
hexane extract ofC. comosaand the two diarylheptanoids were
lipophilic. In previous studies, the hexane extract ofC. comosa
extract was diluted in corn oil or olive oil to prepare formula-
tions for administration of the animals (3,9). To reach a phar-
macologically effective blood level, doses of 125–500 mg/kg
body weight were administered (3,10). Pharmacokinetic analysis
showed that the bioavailability of the major compounds (DA1
and DA2) ofC. comosa extract were reduced by 35% when
dosed at 125 mg/kg in olive oil and that this value was further
reduced when the dose was increased to 250 mg/kg (11). For-
mulating theC. comosaextract and the diarylheptanoids into a
nanoemulsion can improve the intestinal absorption and in-
crease the absorption rates of DA1 and DA2 by five- to tenfold.
Higher bioavailability with lower administered doses ofC.
comosa extract and diarylheptanoids was expected by formulat-
ing them in nanoemulsions. The improvement in the absorption
of the nanoemulsion was evidently due to the smaller droplet
sizes and the presence of surfactants which might aid access of
the lipophilic compounds to the intestine mucosa. The improve-
ment in absorption of the active compounds in the
nanoemulsion was similar to that observed for other compounds
such as St. John's wort extract in which formulation in a
nanoemulsion resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in bioavailability
compared to the general extract formulation (16). Moreover, a
curcumin nanoemulsion was reported to be comparable to the
activity of free curcuminin vitro against a panel of human
pancreatic cancer cell lines (14).
In this study, the nanoemulsions were prepared by a two-
step homogenization method. The first step was performed to
yield a pre-emulsion; this was followed by high-pressure ho-
mogenization to generate a nanosized diarylheptanoid emul-
sion. Both Tween 60 and cetomacrogol 1000 are nonionic
surfactants that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical
products based on their safety and compatibility. The amounts

of these compounds in the formulation were under their LD50
values (60 mL/kg and 2–4 g/kg, respectively) (23). Olive oil
was used due to its ability to solubilize diarylheptanoids. The
obtained nanoemulsion droplets were monodisphere and
spherical with diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm and zeta
potentials less than−10 mV (24). High entrapment efficiencies
and drug loading ratios of both DA1 and DA2 in the
nanoemulsion were observed. By thein situabsorption, there
were no changes in the concentrations of phenol red in the
after intestinal perfusate, indicating that the absorption of
DA1 and DA2 from C.c-Nano and DA-Nano was not induced
by a physical leakage, such as the tight-junction damage.
However, the possible mechanism of this increase of intestinal
absorption needed further investigation. These results suggest
that nanoemulsions of these compounds can improve their
absorption and bioavailability for further enhancement of
their therapeutic efficiency.
The C. comosa extract and DAs were stable in their
oil solution. However, their conventional emulsions with a
mean particle size of 14–16 μm were not stable with phase
separation evident within 1 h, so that an absorption test
could not be performed. The stability of the nanoemulsion
was much greater while the particle size of both C.c-nano
and DA-nano formulations did not change as observed at
14 days. Moreover, after keeping the formulations up to
3 months, there were no changes in their physical appear-
ance. It is noticed that the particle size of DA-Nano was
twofold larger than that o f the C.c-Nano emulsion
(Table III). This might be because the crude extract
contained more components than just two purified com-
pounds. These components mi ght function as co-surfac-
tants, which were initially partitioned into the interface,
reducing the energy of the interface and removing the
hydrophobic parts of the surfactant from contacts with
water, finally resulting in the smaller particle size of crude
extract formulation than that containing of DA1 and DA2
(25). More interestingly, the smaller particle size resulted
in the increased absorption of DA2 but not of DA1
(Fig. 5). The reason was unknown, but it provided the
information of how particle sizes affect the absorption of
DA1 and DA2.
Although higher absorption rates of diarylheptanoids
were observed when formulated in nanoemulsions, a demon-
stration of greater bioavailability needed to be obtained. After
the active compounds were absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract, their concentrations in blood were also dependent on
the first pass liver metabolism as well as by post-hepatic
enzymes. Further study on the metabolite pattern of the
diarylheptanoids is essential. Nanoemulsions may also induce
changes in the absorption pattern of the other compounds
included in the crude extract. Thus, pharmacological and tox-
icological studies ofC. comosa extract and diarylheptanoids
formulated in nanoemulsions are also required.
CONCLUSION
Nanoemulsions containing diarylheptanoids orC. comosa
extract were successfully prepared by a two-step process. The-
se nanoemulsions were uniform and had high entrapment
efficiencies and drug loading ratios. The intestinal absorption
