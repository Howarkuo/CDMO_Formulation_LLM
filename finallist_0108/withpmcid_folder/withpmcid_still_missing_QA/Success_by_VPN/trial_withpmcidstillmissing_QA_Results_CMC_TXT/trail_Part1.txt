=== PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION ANALYSIS (Part 1) ===
Model Used: gemini-2.5-flash

SUMMARY:
This study focused on preparing and assessing the kinetic stability of an injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion featuring cationic droplets, stabilized by a poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film, without the use of phospholipids. Key findings indicate that the emulsion maintained physical stability in terms of mean droplet diameter across various storage temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 37°C) for up to 6 months. However, higher storage temperatures (37°C) led to a progressive decrease in pH and zeta potential due to the liberation of free fatty acids from castor oil. The inclusion of cryoprotectants (5% sucrose + 5% sorbitol) significantly improved the emulsion's stability against droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. The developed phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion shows promise as a versatile drug delivery vehicle for a range of active pharmaceutical ingredients, from small molecules to macromolecules.

Q: 1. What were the primary objectives of the present work regarding the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion?
A: The primary objectives were to prepare a castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion with cationic droplets stabilized by a poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and to assess its kinetic stability after thermal processing and freeze–thaw cycling. The reasoning is that evaluating both preparation and stability under stress conditions is crucial for developing a robust pharmaceutical formulation.
Source: The objectives of the present work were to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm and to assess the kinetic stability of the prepared cationic emulsion after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze– thaw cycling. Presence of cryoprotectants (5%,w/w, sucrose +5%, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C over a period of up to 6 months, no signiﬁcant change was noted in mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did not. This indicates that at 37°C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values. Thus, the injectable castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion could be useful for incorporating various active pharmaceutical ingredients that are in size from small molecular drugs to large macromolecules such as oligonucleotides.

Q: 2. Why are oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsions considered meta-stable dispersions and prone to instability processes?
A: O/w nano-sized emulsions are heterogeneous dispersions of two immiscible liquids and are considered meta-stable dispersions, unlike thermodynamically stable microemulsions. According to the second law of thermodynamics, they are inherently subjected to various instability processes such as aggregation, flocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and eventual phase separation, due to their high interfacial energy.
Source: An oil-in-water (o/w) nano-sized emulsion is a heterogeneous dispersion of two immiscible liquids. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the o/w nano-sized emulsion is subjected to various instability processes like aggregation, flocculation, coalescence, Ostwald ripening, and hence eventual phase separation (1,2). Unlike microemulsions which are thermodynamically stable and clear transparent liquid system, macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions are meta-stable dispersions. However, the stability of the o/w macro (coarse)- and nano-sized emulsions can substantially be improved with the help of suitable emulsifiers or emulgators that are capable of forming a mono- or multilayer coating film around the dispersed oil droplets in order to reduce interfacial tension and to increase droplet–droplet repulsion (3).

Q: 3. Describe the key steps involved in the preparation of the phospholipidless castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion.
A: The preparation involved heating castor oil and α-tocopherol to 70°C, dissolving chitosan in acetic acid and heating to 70°C, and dissolving poloxamer 188 and glycerin in water and heating to 70°C. The castor oil was added to the chitosan solution, followed by the poloxamer–glycerin solution, and stirred. The mixture was then heated to 85°C, mixed with a high shear mixer for 5 min, and rapidly cooled. Further homogenization was performed using a two-stage homogenizer at 9000 £/in.2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane, packed under nitrogen, and sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. This multi-stage process ensures proper mixing, size reduction, and sterilization for an injectable formulation.
Source: The phospholipidless and castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion was prepared according to the method described elsewhere [6]. In brief, 5 ml of castor oil and 0.05 ml ofα-tocopherol were taken in a beaker and heated up to 70°C. Two hundred fifty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C. Five hundred milligrams of poloxamer 188 was dissolved in 50 ml double distilled water containing 1.125 g glycerin in a separate beaker and heated up to 70°C. Castor oil was added to chitosan solution and then poloxamer– glycerin solution was added and stirred well by means of a magnetic stirrer. The resulting mixture was further heated to a temperature of 85°C. At this temperature, the obtained crude emulsion was further mixed by a high shear mixer Polytron (Kinematica, Luzerne, Switzerland) for 5 min and rapidly cooled to below 20°C. After cooling, the emulsion was homogenized using a two-stage homogenizer valve assembly (Gaulin Homogenizer, APV Gaulin, Hilversum, the Netherlands) at 9000 £/in.2 for 5 min. The emulsion was then filtered through a TE membrane filter (Schuell and Schleicher, Dassel, Germany) with a pore size of 0.45μm. The emulsion was packed under nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. In total, nine replicate emulsion samples were prepared using the same ingredients with identical experimental conditions.

Q: 4. What were the initial mean droplet diameter, zeta potential, and viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion?
A: The initial mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218–250 nm, with a monodispersed distribution. The zeta potential was approximately +41.4 mV (from Table I, 0 months, 4°C). The viscosity of the freshly prepared emulsion was 1.5 cps. These parameters are critical for characterizing the initial state and stability potential of the nano-emulsion.
Source: Table I shows mean droplet diameter of the o/w nano-sized emulsion. The mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218– 250 nm and presented a monodispersed droplet size distribution. As expected, the zeta potential of the developed emulsion was also in positive unit due to the presence of cationic polysaccharide (chitosan) at the mixed emulgator ﬁlm. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. In addition, the viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion for- mulation was measured and found to be 1.5 cps.

Q: 5. What issues were associated with phospholipid-containing emulsions, even with the inclusion of antioxidants, that necessitated the development of a phospholipidless formulation?
A: Even with antioxidants, phospholipid-containing emulsions were prone to the liberation of free fatty acids from phospholipid components. This led to the generation of a microclimate acidic pH near the oil phase, oil–water interface, and water phase, which could be harmful to incorporated drug molecules, especially peptides or proteins due to potential structural degradation. This problem highlighted the need for a phospholipidless emulsion to avoid these pH-related stability issues.
Source: In general, the o/w type nano-sized emulsion (meant for parenteral and topical applications) consists of 0.5– 20% of oil or oil mixture, 0.1– 10% of an emulgator, 0.05– 5% of a nonionic surfactant, and permitted amount of preservatives and osmotic agent (5). The remaining proportion comprises an aqueous component. To make anionic o/w nano-sized emulsion, phospholipid-like Lipoid E80 either alone or in combination with a water-soluble nonionic surfactant (poloxamer) and a stabilizer-like oleic acid/cholic acid/deoxycholic acid or its sodium salt was used as emulgator (3). In addition, a cationic o/w nano-sized emulsion was prepared and stabilized by forming a mixed emulgator ﬁlm comprising phospholipids, poloxamer, and stearylamine/oleylamine at the o/w interface of the oil droplets (4,7). Antioxidants such asα-tocopherol was also included in most of the developed nano-sized emulsions in order to prevent the oxidative degradation of phospholipid or other emulsion components and thus the minimization of free fatty acid formation in phospholipid-based emulsions following autoclave sterilization and subsequent storage at stipulated conditions. However, even with the addition of antioxidants, the phospholipid-containing emulsion was prone to the liberation of free fatty acids (from phospholipid components), leading to the generation microclimate acidic pH in the vicinity of the oil phase, oil– water interface, and water phase of the emulsion (8,9). The microclimate pH thus generated might be harmful to the emulsion-incorporated drug molecules. Up to now, the adjustment of pH of the sterilized emulsion by adding mild alkali is the only viable option to prepare the emulsion with desired near neutral value (pH ≈7). If free fatty acid was released or mild alkali solution was added during the formulation of phospholipid- stabilized emulsion, then incorporation of peptide or protein into the emulsion might be questionable due to its possible structural degradation/modi ﬁcation. In this context, it becomes necessary to develop an emulsion without the addition of phospholipid emulgator but still shows the required kinetic stability for at least over months. Therefore, castor oil, poloxamer– chitosan, and water are being selected respectively as the model oil– emulgators– water components to prepare the phospholipidless nano-sized emulsion.

Q: 6. What was the specific emulgator film used to stabilize the o/w nano-sized emulsion in this study, and what were the amounts of key components used?
A: The o/w nano-sized emulsion was stabilized with a poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film, without the addition of any phospholipid emulgator. The amounts used were 5 ml of castor oil, 500 mg of poloxamer, and 250 mg of chitosan. This specific combination was chosen to achieve stability while avoiding the issues associated with phospholipids.
Source: In the current investigation, a well-known combined emulsiﬁcation and homogenization technique was used to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion. Without the addition of any phospholipid emulgator, the o/w nano-sized emulsion was stabilized with the poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm. In an arbitrary manner, the amount of castor oil, poloxamer, and chitosan was chosen and kept respectively at 5 ml, 500 mg, and 250 mg to prepare the nine replicate emulsion samples.

Q: 7. Why was castor oil selected as the oil phase for this nano-sized emulsion, despite its higher viscosity and previous stability issues in phospholipid-stabilized formulations?
A: Castor oil was selected because, in preliminary experiments, other commonly used lower viscosity oils (MCT, soybean oil, sesame seed oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil) failed to produce a stable emulsion system with the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier combination. Additionally, castor oil has a higher solubilization capacity for peptidic molecules like cyclosporin A, which is a significant advantage for drug delivery, outweighing its higher viscosity.
Source: In the medicalﬁeld, most of the nano-sized emulsion was prepared utilizing the lower viscosity and digestible oils, derived from the family of triglycerides, like medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), soybean oil, sesame seed oil, cottonseed oil, and saf ﬂower oil. In our preliminary experiments, none of the aforementioned oils is able to produce a stable emulsion system when poloxamer– chitosan emulsiﬁer combination is used. Previous literature references show that using corn oil as the oil phase and lecithin– chitosan as the emulsiﬁer combination resulted in a stable emulsion system (10,11). In addition, it was shown previously in the phospholipid-stabilized emulsion that when using castor oil as a single oil phase, the ﬁnal emulsion did not show stable behavior in the long-term stability ( 12). But it was our experience that in comparison to other oils, castor oil has higher solubilization capacity to dissolve peptidic molecule like cyclosporin A (9). Therefore, despite its higher viscosity, castor oil alone was used in that previous study to prepare the phospholipid-stabilized emulsion containing cyclosporin A.

Q: 8. What is the proposed mechanism by which the poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film stabilizes the dispersed castor oil droplets?
A: The stabilization is attributed to a combination of steric and electrostatic repulsions. Chitosan, a cationic polysaccharide, localizes at the oil–water interface and intercalates between nonionic poloxamer molecules, forming a mixed emulgator film. This results in an overall positive surface charge (zeta potential) and steric hindrance, preventing droplet coalescence upon random collisions.
Source: Table I shows mean droplet diameter of the o/w nano-sized emulsion. The mean droplet diameter was in the range of 218– 250 nm and presented a monodispersed droplet size distribution. As expected, the zeta potential of the developed emulsion was also in positive unit due to the presence of cationic polysaccharide (chitosan) at the mixed emulgator ﬁlm. By comparing the positive zeta potential with mean particle diameter at nanoscale level, it could be deduced that chitosan molecules are localized at the oil– water interface and intercalated between the nonionic poloxamer molecules. Therefore, the combination of steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsions was responsible for the stabilization of dispersed castor oil droplets in the phospholipidless o/w nano-sized emulsion. In addition, the viscosity of the freshly prepared nano-sized emulsion for- mulation was measured and found to be 1.5 cps.

Q: 9. How did storage temperature and time (up to 6 months) affect the mean droplet diameter and zeta potential of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion?
A: No significant changes were noted in the mean droplet diameter up to 37°C over 6 months, indicating physical stability. However, the zeta potential decreased with increasing storage temperature and time. The initial zeta potential was +41.4 mV. After 6 months, it decreased to +30.6±1.37 mV at 37°C, +37.2±2.35 mV at 25°C, and remained at +37.8±0.89 mV at 4°C. This suggests that lower temperatures are more adequate for maintaining the emulsion's surface charge.
Source: The effect of storage temperature and time on the droplet mean diameter and zeta potential values of castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion was followed up to 6 months’ storage time at three differ ent temperature conditions (Table I). It should be emphasized that in total, nine independent emulsion samples were used to perform the stability assessment. Up to 37°C, no signiﬁcant changes were noted in mean droplet diameter. This indicates that over this 6-month period, castor oil- based nano-sized emulsion remained physically stable. However, depending on the storage temperatures, the zeta potential of the emulsion was found to decrease. Immediately after the preparation of fresh emulsion, the measured zeta potential was about + 41.4 mV (Table I). The observed high positive zeta potential value was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions and even following autoclave sterilization at elevated temperature. Keeping the emulsion at 37°C for up to 6 months decreased the zeta potential to +30.6±1.37 mV. The same emulsion stored at 25°C showed a lesser reduction in the zeta potential (+37.2±2.35 mV). At 4°C, the zeta potential of the emulsion was still found to be +37.8±0.89 mV. Statistical analysis of these data revealed signiﬁcant differ- ences (p<0.05; Table I). From this result, it appears that the lowest temperature was more adequate for castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion storage in terms of the emulsi ﬁed particle’s surface charge. It should be emphasized that an excessive shaking (100 strokes/minutes over 24 h) of the emulsion was performed following the completion of the storage conditions in order to verify the inﬂuence of the storage conditions and mechanical stress on the droplet diameter. No change in the mean droplet diameter was observed, indicating the lack of any inﬂuence before and after shaking of the emulsion.

Q: 10. Explain the observed changes in the emulsion's pH as a function of storage temperature and time.
A: The emulsion's pH progressively reduced at 25°C and 37°C, with a more significant reduction (1 to 4 units) at 37°C. This is attributed to the liberation of free fatty acids from castor oil, which is accelerated at higher temperatures, leading to auto-alteration of the emulsion's pH. At 4°C, the pH reduction was delayed (starting after 2 months) and less pronounced (only by one unit), indicating better pH stability at lower temperatures.
Source: The change in pH of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion with time as a function of storage temperature is depicted in Fig.1. The ﬁgure clearly shows the reduction of the emulsion’s pH at 25°C and 37°C. It should be noted that the initial pH of the emulsion was adjusted to 7.0 using a mild acid before subjecting the emulsion to sterilization. However, a progressive reduction in pH (1 to 4 units) of the emulsion was noticed when stored at 37°C. The higher is the storage temperature, the more is the liberation of free fatty acid from castor oil, resulting in the auto-alteration of the emulsion’s pH. At 4°C, it is interesting to see that the initial reduction of pH started only after 2 months, and even after its initiation, the progression in the reduction of pH was also not so rapid in the following months as compared to the higher storage temperatures. Thus, pH decreased only by one single unit.

------------------------------
Q: 11. How does the decrease in pH and zeta potential at higher temperatures not lead to a significant increase in droplet diameter?
A: Despite the decrease in pH and zeta potential, the emulsion maintained droplet diameter stability due to the robust mixed poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and the initially high positive zeta potential. Chitosan's protonated amino groups provide a positive charge in acidic solutions. Even with some reduction, the remaining positive zeta potential, combined with the steric repulsion from poloxamer, was sufficient to prevent droplet coalescence and maintain the stability of the nano-sized particles.
Source: The combined implications of decreasing zeta potential and pH within the studied storage conditions in the absence of signi ﬁcant droplet diameter increase could be explained on the basis of the mixed poloxamer– chitosan emulgator ﬁlm and the observed high positive zeta potential value. Chitosan has a positive charge in acidic solutions due to the presence of protonated amino groups along its backbone that have pKa values between 6.3 and 7.0 (10,11). During emulsiﬁcation, chitosan molecules are localized at the interface and interca- lated between the nonionic surfactants. Hence, a mixed interfacial ﬁlm comprising the poloxamer and chitosan molecules was formed at the o/w interface which resulted in an overall positive surface charge (zeta potential). The high positive zeta potential value observed even after the higher storage temperatures was sufﬁcient enough to prevent droplet coalescence upon random collisions. Moreover, the combined steric (by poloxamer) and electrostatic (by cationic chitosan) repulsive forces were also operating onto the dispersed castor oil droplets to maintain the stability of the produced nano- sized particles. It should be added that the viscosity of the emulsion stored at three different temperatures did not show any signiﬁcant change (data not shown). This result further substantiates the interfacial properties of the chitosan along with poloxamer. Consequently, no signiﬁcant droplet diameter increase was noted in the emulsion.

Q: 12. What was the effect of freeze–thaw cycling on the emulsion's mean particle size in the absence of cryoprotectants, and what are the proposed mechanisms for this instability?
A: In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size progressively increased from 243 nm to 480 nm after five freeze–thaw cycles, indicating extensive droplet aggregation. The proposed mechanisms include: 1) water crystallization confining oil droplets, leading to closer proximity and coalescence due to insufficient hydration; 2) increased ionic strength in the freeze-concentrated aqueous phase; 3) ice crystal penetration disrupting interfacial membranes; and 4) fat crystallization within droplets promoting partial coalescence.
Source: Preliminary experiments indicated that the emulsion was unstable for freeze– thaw cycling in the absence of cryoprotectants. Dependence of mean particle diameter of the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion on the number of freeze– thaw cycles (−10°C for 22 h/30°C for 2 h) in the absence and presence of cryoprotectants is depicted in Fig. 2. In the absence of cryoprotectants, the mean particle size of the emulsion was found to increase progressively from 243 to 480 nm after ﬁve cycles. A number of physicochemical mechanisms may be responsible for the extensive droplet aggregation observed in the absence of cryoprotectants. First, when the emulsion was placed in the freezer, some of its water crystallized. This caused the dispersed oil droplets to come into closer proximity because the oil droplets were conﬁned to the nonfrozen regions remaining in the aqueous phase (16). When there was no presence of sufﬁcient free water to fully hydrate the oil droplet surfaces (17– 19), the droplet– droplet interactions was forced closer together to effect coalescence to occur. Second, ice crystallization led to an increase in the ionic strength of the freeze-concentrated non-frozen aqueous phase surrounding the emulsion droplets (18). Third, it is possible that ice crystals formed during freezing may have penetrated into the oil droplets and disrupted their interfacial membranes. This allowed the oil droplets more prone to coalescence between them. Fourth, cooling may have caused some of the fat in the emulsion droplets to crystallize promoting partial coalescence due to penetration of a fat crystal from one droplet through the membrane of another droplet (20,21).

Q: 13. How did the presence of cryoprotectants (5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol) impact the emulsion's stability during freeze–thaw cycling?
A: The presence of cryoprotectants significantly improved the emulsion's stability during freeze–thaw cycling. The mean droplet diameter remained around 240 nm after one cycle and only increased to 260 nm after five cycles, demonstrating effective prevention of droplet aggregation. This is a substantial improvement compared to the 480 nm increase without cryoprotectants.
Source: In contrast, the presence of cryoprotectants improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze– thaw cycling. For example, after one cycle, there was no signiﬁcant change in the mean droplet diameter in the castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing 5% sucrose and 5% sorbitol (which remained the same around 240 nm), and even after ﬁve cycles, the mean droplet diameter increased to 260 nm only.

------------------------------
Q: 14. What are the proposed mechanisms by which cryoprotectants enhance the stability of emulsions against aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling?
A: Cryoprotectants improve stability by two main mechanisms: 1) They increase the osmolyte concentration in the aqueous phase, reducing its crystallization temperature, which limits ice crystal formation and increases the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to oil droplets. 2) They form hydrogen bonds with emulsifiers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency for interactions between droplet surfaces when free water content is reduced by ice crystallization.
Source: A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the ability of cryoprotectants to improve the stability of emulsions to aggregation during freeze – thaw cycling. First, cryoprotectants increased the osmolyte concen- tration in the aqueous phase, thereby reducing its crystal- lization temperature. Subsequently, the total amount of ice crystal formation was limited, and therefore, the volume of non-frozen aqueous phase available to the oil droplets was increased (18). Second, cryoprotectants formed hydrogen bonds with emulsiﬁers adsorbed to droplet surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency for interactions to occur between droplet surfaces when the free water content was reduced by ice crystallization (19).

Q: 15. What specific packaging and sterilization methods were employed for the emulsion, and what is their significance for an injectable product?
A: The emulsion was packed under a nitrogen atmosphere in siliconized glass bottles and then sterilized by steam autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. Packing under nitrogen prevents oxidative degradation of emulsion components, while steam autoclaving ensures sterility, which is critical for injectable pharmaceutical products to prevent microbial contamination.

Q: 16. Besides long-term storage and freeze–thaw cycling, what other accelerated stability tests were performed on the emulsion, and what parameters were assessed?
A: Steam sterilization at 121°C for 15 min was considered an accelerated stability test, with creaming and phase separation assessed visually. Additionally, an accelerated mechanical stress test was performed by shaking emulsion bottles at 100 strokes/minute for 24 hours at 25°C, with droplet size evaluated before and after this agitation to assess mechanical and physical resistance.
Source: Since sterilization for 15 min is a drastic operation, it constitutes an accelerated stability test by itself. Creaming and phase separation were then assessed visually after sterilization. To evaluate the mechanical and physical resist- ance, the emulsion should be subjected to an accelerated mechanical stress. For this purpose, those emulsion bottles which were stored at the already stated temperature con- ditions for up to 6 months’ time were shaken at 100 strokes/ minute by an oscillatory agitation motion over 24 h at 25°C. The droplet size was evaluated before and after this accel- erated test.

Q: 17. What are the key advantages of nano-sized emulsion systems that make them promising drug delivery vehicles?
A: Key advantages include natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization (in the oil phase or at the o/w interface), minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability. These properties make nano-sized emulsions suitable for parenteral and topical (ocular and percutaneous) applications.
Source: The advantages of the nano-sized emulsion system include: natural biodegradability, sub-micrometer droplet size range, sterilizability, substantial drug solubilization either at the innermost oil phase or at the o/w interface, minimized side effects, and improved bioavailability (4). Due to these advantages, the nano-sized emulsion is now recognized as a promising drug delivery vehicle or carrier for parenteral (5) and topical (ocular and percutaneous) (5,6) applications.

Q: 18. Which common triglyceride oils were found to be unsuitable for producing a stable emulsion system with the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier combination in preliminary experiments?
A: In preliminary experiments, medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), soybean oil, sesame seed oil, cottonseed oil, and safflower oil were all unable to produce a stable emulsion system when the poloxamer–chitosan emulsifier combination was used. This highlights the specificity of excipient-oil interactions for emulsion stability.

Q: 19. What potential challenges might arise during the scale-up manufacturing process for this nano-sized emulsion, based on the described methodology?
A: Potential challenges for scale-up manufacturing include: 1) Maintaining precise temperature control during heating and rapid cooling steps for larger volumes. 2) Ensuring consistent high shear mixing and two-stage homogenization performance (e.g., Polytron, Gaulin Homogenizer) for larger batches to achieve uniform nano-sized droplets. 3) Filtration through a 0.45 μm membrane for large volumes could be slow and prone to clogging. 4) Packing under a nitrogen atmosphere and steam autoclaving large batches while maintaining sterility and preventing degradation requires specialized equipment and validation. Reproducibility across large batches, especially for nano-emulsions, is often difficult.

Two hundred ﬁfty milligrams of chitosan was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid and heated up to 70°C.
